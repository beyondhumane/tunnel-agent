## Unreleased

### Added

- **Devin OAuth provider** (`OAuthService`, `OAuthTokenDetector`, `ProviderCatalogService`, `ProviderIconRegistry`, `ProviderViewModel`, `ModelFetchService`): connect Devin (Cognition) through CLIProxyAPI's `-devin-login` flow. Detects `devin-*.json` auth files, shows the Devin brand icon from [@lobehub/icons](https://lobehub.com/icons), and labels `cognition`-owned models as Devin/OAuth.
- **Devin quota** (`QuotaFetchService`, `QuotaView`, `MainWindowViewModel`): new Devin tab after Codex showing daily/weekly quota, plan badge, and extra-usage balance via Devin's `GetUserStatus` Connect-RPC endpoint, using the CLIProxyAPI session token.
- **Meta (Muse Spark) CLIProxyAPI provider** (`OAuthService`, `OAuthTokenDetector`, `ProviderCatalogService`, `ProviderIconRegistry`, `ProviderViewModel`, `ModelFetchService`): connect Meta accounts via CLIProxyAPI's `-meta-login` device-code flow; `meta-*.json` credentials are detected, toggled and removed like other OAuth providers. Account lookups also match by the JSON `email` field because Meta sanitizes the email in the filename. Brand icon from `@lobehub/icons`.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Management key visibility toggle** (`ConfigurationView`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the management key field is masked by default, matching every other credential input in the app, with an eye/eye-off button to reveal it.
- **Codex saved rate-limit resets ("banked resets")** (`QuotaFetchService`, `ProviderViewModel`, `QuotaView`, `MainWindowViewModel`): Codex accounts on an eligible plan can bank an early reset of the current usage window. Quota now shows a collapsible "Usage limit resets" section per account listing every redeemable reset (title + expiry) with a "Use reset" button; consuming one re-fetches usage so the bars update immediately. Calls ChatGPT's own backend directly, independent of CLIProxyAPI.

### Fixed

- **Management key row broke on narrow panels** (`ConfigurationView`): the control group (field, eye, copy, regenerate, apply) wrapped onto a new line instead of squeezing the label down to one character per line on narrow windows.
- **Credential backups showed up as accounts in CLIProxyAPI's own management UI** (`ProviderCatalogService`): resetting, disconnecting, or removing an OAuth account backed up the deleted token file to `.tunnelagent-backup\` inside `auth-dir` — the exact folder CLIProxyAPI scans for its `management.html` credential list, so old backups appeared there as extra accounts. Backups now go to `LocalDataDirectory\credential-backups\` instead, outside `auth-dir`.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Editable management key** (`ConfigurationView`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the management API / control panel password (`ManagementKey`) can now be copied, typed in directly, or regenerated to a new random value from Configuration → CLIProxyAPI → Security. Any change rewrites `proxy-config.yaml` and restarts CLIProxyAPI if it's running.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **CLIProxyAPI web control panel toggle** (`ConfigurationView`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ConfigService`): a new setting under Configuration → CLIProxyAPI → Security lets you serve the management page (`management.html`) on the proxy port instead of always disabling it. Toggling restarts CLIProxyAPI if it's running.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **Sidebar submenu chevrons** (`MainWindow.axaml`, `Controls.axaml`, `FallbackView.axaml`): Quota and Fallback arrows now use the primary foreground color and rotate 90° with the same 0.18s CubicEaseOut transition as virtual-model expanders, instead of swapping muted right/down icons.

### Fixed

- **Icon buttons flashed a gray fill on click** (`Controls.axaml`): Fluent's pressed state still painted a background on `icon` / `icon-btn` controls. Press now stays transparent like the theme toggle, while scale feedback and the current pagination highlight are unchanged.
- **Sidebar selection pill shifted after collapsing Quota or Fallback** (`MainWindow.axaml.cs`): collapsing a submenu after moving to another section left the accent pill on a stale Y and sometimes indented by the child margin, so hover/selection looked offset (e.g. on Configuration). The pill now stays full-rail width, X is pinned to 0, and it is remeasured after the submenu layout settles.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **Collapsed sidebar hid Quota and Fallback children** (`MainWindow.axaml`, `MainWindow.axaml.cs`, `Controls.axaml`): collapsing the rail left empty selected submenu pills because child labels were hidden in-place. Those groups now open a flyout beside the icon, the parent keeps the sliding pill and hover while a child is active or the flyout is open, and first/last flyout hover fills the rounded corners.
- **Sidebar nav clipped when Quota and Fallback submenus are expanded** (`MainWindow.axaml`): the navigation list now lives in the sidebar's remaining-height row inside a `ScrollViewer`, so extra items scroll instead of pushing Status and the footer off-screen in a short window.
- **Sidebar overlay scrollbar sat on nav badges** (`MainWindow.axaml`, `Controls.axaml`): inset the nav scroller so the thumb sits in a gutter instead of against chevrons and counts.
- **9Router left running after Tunnel Agent crashes** (`NineRouter/ProcessService`): the Node.js process tree is assigned to a Windows job with kill-on-close so a crash or Task Manager kill of Tunnel Agent also terminates 9Router, and a PID file is reaped on the next start if a leftover instance still holds the port.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **9Router dashboard security** (`ConfigurationView`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `NineRouter/ApiClient`): manage client API keys and the default agent key; require API keys for `/v1`; require dashboard login; and set a dashboard password that Tunnel Agent reuses for local management requests.

### Fixed

- **9Router tray usage spacing** (`TrayUsagePopup`): added consistent spacing between 9Router connection cards and between individual usage bars when reset text is absent.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **9Router managed engine** (`EngineCatalog`, `NineRouter/*`, `AgentConfigurationService`, `README.md`): install 9Router from npm (Node.js 18+), start and stop it alongside CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity, configure and open its dashboard, and point coding agents at `http://127.0.0.1:20128/v1` with `TUNNEL_AGENT_9ROUTER_API_KEY`.
- **9Router provider management** (`NineRouterProviderCatalog`, `ProvidersView`, `NineRouter/*`): add API-key connections or sign in Claude / Gemini / Copilot over OAuth; filter and page the provider catalog; enable, rename, or delete connections; configure per-provider round robin; and surface custom provider icons and connection errors.
- **9Router model combos** (`NineRouterCombosViewModel`, `NineRouterComboOverlayView`): create, edit, reorder, and delete ordered model combos with sequential, round-robin, or fusion strategies (including an optional fusion judge model).
- **9Router usage** (`DashboardView`, `NineRouterUsageViewModel`, `QuotaView`, `TrayUsagePopup`): show seven-day request, token, cache, and cost aggregates; active requests; per-provider totals; and paginated redacted request details on Home, plus each connected account's usage and plan limits in Quota and the tray popup.

### Changed

- **Animated tab content** (`ConfigurationView`, `LogsView`, `ProvidersView`): sliding tab bodies now animate when the selected tab changes.

### Fixed

- **Tray usage popup opened in a screen corner** (`TrayService`): the popup is now placed beside the tray-icon cursor position.
- **Cursor quota showed the old single spend bar** (`CursorQuotaParser`, `QuotaFetchService`): Cursor Settings now reports **Auto + Composer** and **API** as separate percent buckets (`autoPercentUsed` / `apiPercentUsed`). Quota uses those bars instead of `includedSpend/limit`, keeps on-demand spend when present, and falls back to `/auth/usage` or usage-summary when `planUsage` is missing (Team/Enterprise). Token refresh retries both dashboard calls; parse/network failures surface as a quota error instead of an empty "not loaded" state.
- **Cursor quota read a stale AppData account** (`CursorStateStore`): Scoop/portable Cursor keeps `state.vscdb` under `data/user-data`, while an older `%APPDATA%\Cursor` install can still contain an expired login. Scan and fetch now pick the newest existing database among AppData, LocalAppData, and Scoop paths.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **Model metadata now comes from models.dev** (`ModelsDevService`, `ModelPricing`, `AgentConfigurationService`): OpenRouter's model metadata and pricing cache was replaced with models.dev's public catalog, including provider-specific pricing, context window, image, reasoning, display-name metadata, and cleanup of the legacy `openrouter-models.json` cache after the new cache loads or writes.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **Model Fallback broke CLIProxyAPI's /backend-api/ Codex traffic** (`FallbackProxyService.cs`): CLIProxyAPI's `/backend-api/` Codex routes upgrade to a WebSocket connection, but the Fallback proxy was a plain HttpListener/HttpClient reverse proxy with no WebSocket handling, so upgrades silently fell through to the HTTP forwarder and failed. Any virtual model reachable via that path only worked with Fallback disabled. The proxy now detects `IsWebSocketRequest`, accepts the client socket, opens a `ClientWebSocket` to the same upstream path, and relays frames in both directions.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **Pi reset produced an invalid empty configuration** (`AgentConfigurationService.cs`): resetting Pi after removing its last managed provider now preserves the required `"providers": {}` root instead of writing `{}`, preventing Pi from rejecting `~/.pi/agent/models.json`.
- **CLIProxyAPI requests through the pi-cliproxyapi-provider extension missing from logs/stats** (`RequestLogEntry.cs`): the official [pi-cliproxyapi-provider](https://github.com/router-for-me/pi-cliproxyapi-provider) extension registers inference at `{root}/backend-api/` and sends Codex-style traffic to `/backend-api/codex/responses` instead of the standard `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/messages` paths. `IsAiPath`/`InferProvider` only recognized `/v1/*`, `/v1beta/models/`, and `/api/provider/*`, so these requests were silently dropped. `/backend-api/*` paths are now recognized, with `/backend-api/codex/*` tagged as **Codex** and other `/backend-api/*` paths as **OpenAI Completions**.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-23

- **Amp CLI agent removed** (`AgentCatalog.cs`, `README.md`): Amp is no longer offered for agent configuration because CLIProxyAPI removed its Amp integration, management endpoints, and provider routing. Existing Amp files are left untouched.
- **Agent model configuration reset button** (`AgentsView`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `AgentConfigurationService`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): configured agents now show a reset action that opens the existing configuration overlay in reset mode and removes only Tunnel Agent-managed model/provider entries. Pi and OpenCode revert now use their async JSON merge paths instead of failing through the synchronous dispatcher.

### Added

- **Grok Build agent support** (`AgentCatalog.cs`, `AgentConfigurationService.cs`): the Agents window detects `grok` and writes Tunnel Agent models to `~/.grok/config.toml`. Anthropic models use `api_backend = "messages"` (needed for reasoning), the rest use `chat_completions`, and reasoning-capable models get `supports_reasoning_effort = true` so `/effort` works. Config is merged as TOML tables (single `[models]`, one de-duplicated `[model."<id>"]` per model, preserving user tables like `[ui]`) instead of a comment-delimited block, avoiding the duplicate-key TOML that Grok's own rewrites caused.
- **Oh My Pi (OMP) agent support** (`AgentCatalog.cs`, `AgentConfigurationService.cs`): the Agents window detects `omp` and safely merges selected Tunnel Agent models into `~/.omp/agent/models.yml`. OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic models use separate OMP providers, OpenRouter metadata supplies context/image/reasoning capabilities, unrelated YAML providers are preserved, and revert removes only Tunnel Agent-managed entries.

### Fixed

- **Codex weekly quota mislabeled as Primary (5h)** (`QuotaFetchService.cs`): Codex can now return the weekly allowance as `primary_window` with `limit_window_seconds = 604800` and `secondary_window = null` after removing the daily/5-hour window from some accounts. The UI now derives the label from the reported window duration, so 604800 seconds renders as **Weekly** and 18000 seconds still renders as **Primary (5h)**.
- **Tab labels trimmed with an ellipsis on the Home range bar** (`Controls/SlidingTabBar.cs`): the `SlidingTabBar` used equal `Star` columns, so on the left-aligned Home/Dashboard range bar the longest tab (e.g. Spanish **Personalizado**) didn't fit its share and rendered as "Personali…". Each column now gets a `MinWidth` sized to the widest tab's content, so tabs still fill the bar evenly when it stretches (Logs, Providers, Configuration) but never truncate when space is tight. The min width is recomputed on language change since the headers are localized bindings.
- **Redundant tooltips on text tab bars** (`Controls/SlidingTabBar.cs`): the `SlidingTabBar` added a tooltip to every tab bound to its header, so text tabs (Home, Providers, Logs, Configuration) showed a tooltip that merely repeated the visible label. Tooltips are now only attached to icon-only tabs (e.g. the Quota provider tabs), where the header text isn't otherwise visible.
- **Claude quota showed a fabricated reset countdown when unused** (`QuotaFetchService.cs`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): when a Claude rate-limit window (Primary 5h / Weekly) had no usage, the Anthropic API returns `resets_at = null` because the window hasn't started counting yet. The client was inventing a reset time (`now + 5h` / `now + 7d`), so a 0%-used quota falsely displayed "Resets in 4h 59m". The client no longer fabricates a timestamp; instead it shows a new `Quota_ResetPendingSession` label ("Timer starts once you use this quota") across all fourteen supported languages, making clear the countdown only begins once the current session consumes quota.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **Sliding sidebar selection indicator** (`MainWindow.axaml`, `MainWindow.axaml.cs`, `Controls.axaml`): the accent highlight behind the sidebar navigation items is now a single "pill" that slides between options (220ms `CubicEaseInOut` `TranslateTransform`) instead of jumping instantly, mirroring the SlidingTab pill. The pill tracks the selected item's bounds and follows the sidebar collapse/expand width animation; the per-item selected background was made transparent so the moving pill provides the highlight.
- **Smooth animated section switching** (`MainWindow.axaml`): the main content host is now a `TransitioningContentControl` with a `CompositePageTransition` (220ms horizontal `PageSlide` with `CubicEaseInOut` easing plus a `CrossFade`), so navigating between sidebar sections fades/slides between views instead of swapping instantly. Note: switching to a heavy section (e.g. Providers) can still briefly stall while that view lays out for the first time; a follow-up will prewarm/lighten section layout so the transition always plays smoothly.

### Fixed

- **Missing translations for the dashboard Custom range** (`Resources/Strings*.resx`): the Home/Dashboard range selector's `DashboardView_Range_Custom` and `DashboardView_Range_SelectRange` strings were only present in the base (English) and Spanish resources, so the **Custom** tab and its range-picker watermark fell back to English in the other twelve languages. Added both keys to all remaining supported languages.
- **Untranslated "Save changes" in the edit provider dialog** (`Resources/Strings*.resx`): the edit custom provider dialog's `Dialog_EditCustomProvider_Title` and `Dialog_EditCustomProvider_Save` strings existed only in the base resource, so the dialog title and the **Save changes** button rendered in English for every localized language. Added both keys across all fourteen supported languages.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Custom date range on the dashboard** (`DateRangePicker`, `DashboardViewModel`, `DashboardView.axaml`, `Controls.axaml`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the Home/Dashboard range selector gains a **Custom** tab backed by a new single-control `DateRangePicker`. It mirrors the Fluent `CalendarDatePicker` look (editable text box plus a calendar icon button) but selects an inclusive **start – end** span via a range `Calendar` popup, so arbitrary windows such as "yesterday" or a specific week can be inspected. The calendar icon button has a hover/press scale animation and the box clips its hover fill to its rounded corners.

### Changed

- **Logs pagination controls** (`LogsView.axaml`, `LogsViewModel`, `Controls.axaml`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): request-log pagination now uses icon-only first/previous/next/last controls with localized tooltips, hides unavailable navigation actions instead of disabling them, and shows a compact Google-style page range with ellipses. Number buttons keep stable sizing to avoid hover/selection repaint artifacts while the icon buttons retain the existing scale animation.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard summary provider/model labels clipped** (`DashboardView.axaml`): the summary table columns were re-proportioned (wider first column) and the label cell now trims overflow with `CharacterEllipsis` and exposes the full text via a tooltip, so long provider/model names no longer clip or push the numeric columns.
- **Custom (OpenAI-compatible) provider labels normalized** (`DashboardViewModel`, `RequestLogEntry`): provider names are now stripped of the internal `OpenAI-compatible-` prefix before being displayed and grouped, so custom providers show their chosen name in the dashboard summary and request logs (and distinct-provider counts group correctly).
- **Logs pagination number contrast** (`Controls.axaml`): non-current page-number buttons now render with the muted foreground and switch to the full foreground on hover/press, improving contrast and making the current page stand out.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Edit custom provider dialog** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ProvidersView.axaml`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `MainWindow.axaml.cs`, `Resources/Strings.resx`): custom OpenAI-compatible providers now have a pencil **Edit provider** action that opens an in-place popup mirroring the Add dialog, pre-filled with the provider's current name, base URL and API key. Confirming saves the changes via the new `UpdateCustomProviderAsync`, which rewrites `proxy-config.yaml` and rebuilds the provider list. The dialog supports click-outside/Escape to dismiss and Enter to save.
- **Quotio-style Model Fallback bridge** (`FallbackConfiguration`, `FallbackProxyService`, `EngineService`, `ConfigService`, `FallbackViewModel`, `FallbackView.axaml`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): added virtual models that map to ordered provider/model chains and automatically retry the next entry when quota/exhaustion-style responses are returned (`429`, selected `5xx`, auth/quota bodies). When Fallback is enabled, CLIProxyAPI is started behind an internal port and a lightweight local bridge owns the public port; when disabled, CLIProxyAPI runs directly so existing traffic is unaffected. The bridge rewrites chat/completions model ids, caches successful routes, publishes virtual models through `/v1/models`, reports active route state (`N/M provider model`) back to the UI, and is fully localized across all fourteen supported languages.
- **Fallback management UI and Local Proxy status** (`FallbackView.axaml`, `Controls.axaml`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `ConfigurationView.axaml`, `ProviderIconRegistry`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): added a polished Fallback page with Quotio-inspired cards, icon-only actions, provider logos, add-model/add-entry flyouts, minimum-one-entry enforcement, animated expand/collapse (collapsed by default), active-route badges, Quotio credit link, and tooltips. The sidebar now shows consistent clickable status cards for CLIProxyAPI, Perplexity and Local Proxy, each with a status dot and localized tooltip; CLIProxyAPI/Perplexity route to their Providers tabs while Local Proxy scrolls directly to its CLIProxyAPI settings section. The CLIProxyAPI settings page includes a Local Proxy summary card with Providers-style endpoint copy, split route-cache enable/duration controls (including an until-restart cache mode), and internal-port details when the bridge is active. Fallback chains can be reordered with up/down controls (hidden at the ends instead of disabled), cached routes can be reset per virtual model, and individual entries can be marked as the route to use now. Virtual model header actions were reorganized (reset · delete · enable toggle), icon buttons gained hover/press scale animations, the remove-entry button is hidden when only one entry remains, and the experimental badge was removed. Destructive trash icons are now consistently red across Fallback, Home, Logs and Providers.
- **OAuth login feedback toast for every entry point** (`OAuthService`, `OAuthConnectResult`/`OAuthConnectStatus`, `ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ProvidersView.axaml.cs`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the "Add account → OAuth login" dialog button previously called `ConnectOAuthAsync` and discarded its result, so adding an account for a provider that already had one (Claude, Codex, …) ran the flow with no visible feedback. `OAuthService.ConnectAsync` now returns a structured `OAuthConnectResult` (status + dynamic detail) instead of an English string, and `MainWindowViewModel.ConnectOAuthAsync` centralizes the status toast so both the provider-card button and the add-account dialog surface it. New `OAuth_Status_*` strings localized across all fourteen languages.
- **Headless sign-in URL fallback** (`OAuthService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `MainWindow.axaml.cs`): when the login process stays alive, the captured stdout is scanned for an `http(s)` URL (`ExtractAuthUrl`) and surfaced in the toast as a dedicated accent-colored, monospace "endpoint"-style row with an icon-only copy button (Copy→Check), so environments where the binary cannot open a browser can still complete the flow. The toast stays open while a URL is shown.
- **Auto-dismiss on successful authentication** (`OAuthTokenDetector.GetLatestTokenWriteUtc`, `ProviderCatalogService.LatestOAuthTokenWriteUtc`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the OAuth status toast now closes itself once the awaited provider gains a new account **or** its token file is rewritten (re-authenticating an existing account), detected via the auth-dir watcher against a baseline captured when the flow started, with a synchronous post-show check covering fast re-auth.

### Changed

- **Custom provider edit persistence and model refresh** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ModelFetchService`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `ProviderCatalogServiceTests`): editing custom OpenAI-compatible providers now writes the provider name to the proxy-supported `name:` field (not the unsupported `display-name`), validates URL/API key with the same localized error toast as Add, labels the model-selection confirm button as **Save changes** while editing, and restarts CLIProxyAPI after provider/model edits so Available Models refresh deterministically once the edited provider's models are registered.
- **Fallback master switch governs the Local Proxy lifecycle** (`EngineService`, `FallbackViewModel`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the local proxy bridge is now started/stopped solely by the **Enable Fallback** toggle instead of the combined `HasActiveRoutes` (enabled + at least one usable virtual model). Disabling fallback now always stops the proxy, and enabling it starts the proxy even when no virtual models are configured (traffic is forwarded transparently). Adding/removing virtual models no longer restarts the engine since the bridge reads its configuration live; the engine only restarts when the toggle itself changes. The `Enable Fallback` description was updated to explain this across all fourteen supported languages.
- **Monogram fallback for unknown/custom provider icons** (`ProviderIconRegistry`, `FallbackViewModel`, `AvailableModelViewModel`, `ProviderViewModel`, `QuotaProviderViewModel`, `ModelFetchService`, `FallbackView.axaml`, `ProvidersView.axaml`, `QuotaProvidersView.axaml`): providers without a known brand glyph previously rendered the generic OpenAI swirl over a flat gray box, which was misleading for custom providers (whose name is user-chosen and arbitrary, e.g. `Ohjbsdfjh`). Unknown providers now show a **monogram** (the first letter of the display name) over a **stable accent colour derived from the name** (FNV-1a hash into a fixed palette), so custom providers are no longer mislabeled as OpenAI and are visually distinguishable from one another. `ProviderIconRegistry` gained `IsKnown`, `Monogram`, `FallbackColor` and a `GetDisplay` helper that centralizes the icon-vs-monogram decision; known brands (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Kimi, Cursor, …) are unchanged. Applies consistently across the Fallback page (model picker, entry rows, active-route badge), the Providers tab (configured providers and the available-models list) and the Quota providers tab. A user-selectable icon/colour picker remains possible as future work on top of this.

### Fixed

- **Local Proxy sidebar card now scrolls to the section content** (`ConfigurationView.axaml`, `ConfigurationView.axaml.cs`): clicking the sidebar **Local Proxy** status card switched to the CLIProxyAPI configuration tab but the follow-up scroll usually failed — a single delayed jump to the scroll extent raced Avalonia layout while the just-shown CLIProxy panel was still measuring, so the offset was computed against a stale/clamped extent and left the view at the top. The scroll is now retried on a short timer until the Local Proxy section is laid out and then `BringIntoView()` is called on the section card, so the card reliably comes into view.
- **Home momentarily showed hardcoded fallback prices instead of cached OpenRouter pricing** (`OpenRouterContextService`, `MainWindowViewModel`): on launch the dashboard seeded persisted usage events and computed cost figures (`OnUsageEventsLoaded` → `Recompute`) before `WarmModelPricingAsync` had loaded the on-disk OpenRouter price JSON, so the first render briefly used the built-in fallback table. `OpenRouterContextService` gained a synchronous `SeedFromDisk()` that loads the cached `openrouter-models.json` into memory, and `MainWindowViewModel` now calls it before the initial usage seed — so cost estimates use real OpenRouter pricing from the first compute and the hardcoded table is only a true fallback for models the JSON does not list. The background `WarmAsync` refresh still re-fetches stale pricing from the network.
- **Model selection UI froze on "Select all" / search with large providers** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `MainWindow.axaml`): selecting all models (or, for the custom-provider dialog, typing in the search box) froze the UI when a provider exposed hundreds of models (e.g. OpenRouter with 339+). Toggling "Select all" set `IsSelected` on every model, and each change fired the per-item `PropertyChanged` handler which re-evaluated LINQ over the whole list (and, in the agent config overlay's Manual mode, re-ran `RefreshManualPreviewAsync` per model) — an O(n²) cascade. Bulk selection now suppresses the per-item handler and raises the aggregate state once (custom-provider dialog and agent config overlay). The custom-provider model list also switched from a non-virtualizing `ItemsControl` inside a `ScrollViewer` to a virtualizing `ListBox`, so "Select all" and search are now smooth.
- **Theme/Language combos clipped their text** (`ConfigurationView.axaml`): the General → Theme and Language combo boxes were `140px` wide, which truncated longer entries such as "System default". Both are now `155px` so the full text fits.
- **Gray Fluent press background bleeding through all buttons** (`Controls.axaml`): clicking and holding (or click-dragging) almost any button briefly revealed the FluentTheme default `:pressed` gray `ContentPresenter` background, because the custom button styles only overrode `:pointerover`. Added matching `:pressed` states for every affected control (`Button.app`/`.primary`, `rail`, `icon`, `link`, `side`/`.selected`, `proxy-card`, `provider-row-name`, `link-add`, `tab-item`/`.active`, and the `ToggleButton.provider-row`/`model-group` headers) so each uses its own pressed color instead of the stray gray.
- **Off-center provider icons in the Fallback page** (`FallbackView.axaml`): the SimpleIcons glyphs (e.g. OpenAI) in the model-selection popup and virtual-model entry rows looked nudged up and to the left. The icon containers used odd icon/box size differences (an 11px icon in a 20px box → 4.5px margins, 13px in 26px → 6.5px margins), so layout rounding snapped the half-pixel and offset the glyph. The icon sizes are now `12` (popup) and `14` (entries), giving exact integer margins so every fallback icon centers precisely. ProvidersView was unaffected because it already uses even differences (14px in 28/30px boxes).

### Changed

- **OAuth quick-exit success detection by exit code** (`OAuthService`): a login process that exits within the startup window is now judged by its exit code instead of grepping stdout for `"Opening browser"`/`"Attempting to open URL"` literals (which break across binary releases). The exit code is captured inside the `Exited` handler via a `TaskCompletionSource` so callers never touch a disposed `Process`, and the process is always disposed once it exits (a successful login keeps it alive until the user completes the flow).
- **Strip native PDBs from the Scoop zip** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): the SkiaSharp NuGet packages ship `libSkiaSharp.pdb` (~84 MB) and `libHarfBuzzSharp.pdb` (~20 MB) in the publish output, and `DebugType=None` only removes our own managed PDBs. These native symbols are now deleted from `artifacts/publish-scoop` before zipping, so the Scoop zip contains just `TunnelAgent.exe` (no loose DLLs or PDBs) and is substantially smaller.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Smaller Scoop zip** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): the `TunnelAgent-<version>-win-<arch>-scoop.zip` is now produced from a dedicated single-file publish (`PublishSingleFile=true`, `EnableCompressionInSingleFile=true`, `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true`) instead of the multi-file Velopack publish output. The zip now contains just `TunnelAgent.exe` (no loose runtime DLLs) and is substantially smaller. The Velopack packages are unaffected — they still use the multi-file `artifacts/publish` output.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Updater-free Scoop zip** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Windows releases now also publish a plain `TunnelAgent-<version>-win-x64-scoop.zip` (and `win-arm64`) built straight from the publish output, without the Velopack shim, `Update.exe` or `.portable` marker. The Scoop manifest consumes this instead of the Velopack portable zip, so `UpdateManager.IsInstalled` is `false`, the in-app updater stays disabled, and Scoop — not Velopack — owns updates (no more self-updates writing into the Scoop directory). The hash is exposed under `platforms.<rid>.scoop` in `latest.json`.
- **Linux `.deb` and `.rpm` packages** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Linux releases now ship native `.deb` and `.rpm` packages for `linux-x64` and `linux-arm64` alongside the existing `.AppImage`. Velopack only emits AppImages, so the release build now also stages the published app under `/opt/TunnelAgent` with a `/usr/bin/tunnel-agent` symlink, a `.desktop` entry and a hicolor icon, and packages it with `fpm`. The release notes installation table links the new artifacts; auto-update remains AppImage/Velopack-driven (deb/rpm are managed by the system package manager).

### Fixed

- **Engine stuck in `Error` after a failed start** (`ProcessService`, `EngineService`, `IManagedEngine`, `EngineErrorKind`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ProvidersView.axaml`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): when CLIProxyAPI (or Perplexity) was already running in a terminal or another app, starting the managed engine failed and `StartServerAsync` only allowed (re)starting from `Stopped`/`NotInstalled`, so the Start button became a no-op and the whole app had to be restarted. The Start/Restart commands now also start from `Error`. A port pre-flight (`TcpListener`) makes the port-in-use case deterministic instead of racing the foreign instance's health response (which previously surfaced a misleading "Process exited unexpectedly"). Failures now raise a localized error toast (translated for all fourteen languages via the new `Toast_EngineError_PortInUse`/`_Timeout`/`_LaunchFailed`/`_Crashed` strings) driven by a structured `EngineErrorKind`; the toast re-shows on every explicit retry, and the persistent `Error` status label gains a tooltip with the reason so the cause stays visible after the toast fades. Added `scripts/add_resx_keys.py` to insert/translate resource keys across every `Strings*.resx` idempotently.
- **Tests overwriting the real `TUNNEL_AGENT_PERPLEXITY_TOKEN`** (`UserEnvironmentService`, `PerplexityAccountCatalogServiceTests`): `PerplexityAccountCatalogService.SyncEnvVarAsync` calls `UserEnvironmentService.Set/Remove`, which on Windows persists to `HKCU\Environment`. Because the static facade went straight to the OS with no injection seam, every `AddAsync`/`SetDefaultAsync`/`RemoveAsync` in the catalog tests wrote real values (`token-1`, `token-2`, …) into the developer's actual user environment and most tests never cleaned up. Added `UserEnvironmentService.SetImplementation()` so tests can inject an in-memory fake (restoring the previous implementation on dispose); the catalog tests now run fully isolated and no longer touch the OS environment.
- **Empty CLIProxy API key written to agent configs** (`AgentConfigurationService`, `MainWindowViewModel`): when `TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY` had no value, the Pi and OpenCode config builders still emitted the placeholder reference (`${TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY}` / `{env:...}`) because `HasApiKey` was checking the env var *name* (`ModelEntry.ApiKey`), which is never empty, instead of its resolved value. The placeholder then expanded to an empty `apiKey` and the agent failed. The builders now use `HasResolvedApiKey`, which resolves the variable through `UserEnvironmentService` and falls back to `"no-key"` only when it is genuinely unset. Additionally, the API-key reconcile in `RefreshApiKeyItemsAsync` now heals the reverse drift: if the env var is empty but `proxy-config.yaml` (the source of truth) has `api-keys`, the first one is adopted as the default env var, so configs reference a key the proxy actually accepts instead of falling back to `"no-key"` against an auth-required proxy.
- **Dashboard usage chart axis dates** (`DashboardViewModel`): the Home usage chart axis and hover labels only switched from `HH:mm` to a dated format when the data span was `>= 2 days`. With two calendar days of data the actual min→max span fell below that threshold, so both axis ends and the tooltips showed bare times and the days were indistinguishable. The format is now chosen from the real calendar range (`HH:mm` within a day, `MM-dd HH:mm` across days, `yyyy-MM-dd` across months, `yyyy-MM` across years), so days, months and years can be told apart.

### Added

- **Logs request model filter** (`LogsViewModel`, `RequestLogEntry`, `LogsView.axaml`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the Logs → Requests tab now exposes a model filter alongside the provider filter and shows each request as `Provider · model` above the path. Request search and CSV export also include the model.

### Removed

- **Aider agent** (`AgentCatalog`, `AgentConfigurationService`, `Strings*.resx`, `README.md`): removed Aider from the Agents window. Its catalog entry, the env-var config generation (`AiderEnv`/`EnvExportRaw` and the `"aider"` branches in `GenerateRaw`/`WriteConfigSync`), and the now-unused `Agent_aider_Description` localization strings across all fourteen languages were dropped.
- **API-key account labels** (`AppSettings`, `ConfigService`, `ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `MainWindow.axaml`): removed the per-key label feature for upstream API-key accounts. Labels were written to `proxy-config.yaml`, but CLIProxyAPI has no per-key `label` field and strips it whenever it rewrites/normalizes the config (so labels silently disappeared on engine start, and were lost entirely when a native API-key provider was disabled). Since the label added no functional value, it was dropped instead of reworked: the label input is gone from the add-account and add-custom-provider dialogs, `ProviderAccountSettings.Label` and the label read/write paths in `ConfigService` are removed, and `AddAccountAsync`/`AddCustomProviderAsync` no longer take a label. API-key rows now display the masked key. (Perplexity account labels are unaffected.)
- **Dead `CustomProviderCredentialStore`** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `ConfigService`): removed the unused `openai-compat-*.json` credential store and its one-time `MigrateLegacyCredentialStoreAsync` migration (which read, migrated, and deleted the legacy files), plus the unused `credentialStore` constructor parameter on `ConfigService`. Credentials live in `proxy-config.yaml`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Engine update toast localization** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the "&lt;engine&gt; &lt;version&gt; is ready to install." body of the CLIProxyAPI/Perplexity update toast was hardcoded in English while its title was translated. It now resolves through the new `Toast_EngineUpdateAvailable_Body` format string, translated for all fourteen supported languages.

### Added

- **Dashboard summary by provider or model** (`DashboardViewModel`, `DashboardView.axaml`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the usage summary table now has a sliding tab to group rows by provider or by model, reusing the same per-row metrics (calls, success/fail, rate, tokens, estimated cost, last request). The headline cards and chart remain provider-agnostic aggregates. Added `DashboardView_Summary_ByProvider`, `DashboardView_Summary_ByModel` and `DashboardView_Summary_Model` translations for all fourteen languages.
- **Dashboard/Home usage view and usage-backed requests** (`DashboardView`, `DashboardViewModel`, `LogsViewModel`, `UsageChart`, `UsageService`, `UsageStore`, `UsageEvent`, `ModelPricing`, `MainWindow`): added Home as the default sidebar section with usage range tabs, headline metrics, provider summary, an interactive hoverable usage chart, and CLIProxyAPI usage telemetry backed by SQLite persistence. Tunnel Agent enables CLIProxyAPI usage statistics, continuously drains the destructive `/v0/management/usage-queue`, deduplicates events by hash, estimates model token costs, parses cache/reasoning token details, and keeps persisted history across restarts. Dashboard and the Logs → Requests tab now use this telemetry store as their source of truth, while Logs → Proxy logs remains a raw log-file view with separate clear/delete actions and its own renamed auto-refresh setting; clearing usage history is available from Dashboard and Requests and deletes only stored usage events.
- **Dynamic model pricing with on-disk cache** (`OpenRouterContextService`, `ModelPricing`, `DashboardViewModel`, `MainWindowViewModel`): dashboard cost estimates resolve per-model prices from OpenRouter's live `/v1/models` list (input, output, cache-read and cache-write rates), falling back to a built-in table for models OpenRouter does not list. This avoids mispricing models newer than the table, which previously fell back to an older prefix match. The fetched model map is persisted to `openrouter-models.json` under the local data directory and seeded into memory on startup (instant, offline-capable), refreshing from the network only when the cache is missing or older than 24h. Agents configuration reuses the same cached map for context window, reasoning and image-modality metadata.
- **Per-provider cost accounting** (`ModelPricing`): cost estimation distinguishes cache-creation (write) from cache-read tokens and applies the correct token model per provider — Anthropic-style events bill `input` as cache-free with separate write/read rates, while OpenAI-style events use the aggregate-cached subtraction.
- **Dashboard/Home localization across all languages** (`Resources/Strings*.resx`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `DashboardView.axaml`, `LogsView.axaml`): the Home/Dashboard view and the clear-usage-history dialog now ship full translations (`DashboardView_*`, `Sidebar_Home`, `Dialog_ClearUsageHistory_*`) for all fourteen supported languages instead of only English and Spanish, and the clear-usage confirmation dialog uses its own `Dialog_ClearUsageHistory_Cancel` key. The shared clear-usage-history tooltip (used on Home and the Logs → Requests tab) was renamed from `LogsView_ClearUsageHistoryTooltip` to the view-neutral `Common_ClearUsageHistoryTooltip` and translated for every language.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Pi model reasoning flag** (`OpenRouterContextService`, `AgentConfigurationService`): when configuring Pi, each model's reasoning support is now resolved from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint (presence of the per-model `reasoning` object or `"reasoning"` in `supported_parameters`) and written as `"reasoning": true` per-model in `models.json`. The field is omitted for models without reasoning support, so it does not add redundant noise to the config. The manual preview resolves the same flag, so what you see matches what Apply writes.
- **Custom provider model selection** (`UpstreamModelFetchService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ConfigService`, `ProviderSettings`, `MainWindow.axaml`): adding a custom OpenAI-compatible provider now probes `{base-url}/models`; on HTTP 200 a model-selection popup lists the upstream models (search + select-all, all unchecked, at least one required) and the chosen models are persisted under the provider's `models:` block in `proxy-config.yaml`. A non-200 or unreachable URL aborts the add and shows a top-right error toast without creating the provider.
- **Edit custom provider models** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ProvidersView`): custom provider rows now have an edit-models button that re-fetches `{base-url}/models` and reopens the selection popup with the currently exposed models pre-checked, so newly released or changed models can be added/removed without recreating the provider. The button shows a per-provider loading spinner and is disabled while the upstream fetch is in flight, so it no longer appears to hang on click.
- **Upstream API key providers** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `ConfigService`, `ProvidersView`, `MainWindow`): added native API-key flows for Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini plus custom OpenAI-compatible providers stored in `proxy-config.yaml`, with add/edit dialogs, duplicate-key toast feedback, custom-provider add/remove actions, and localized UI strings.
- **Custom provider key deletion** (`ConfigService`, `ProviderCatalogService`): deleting the last API key from a custom OpenAI-compatible provider now keeps the provider entry but removes the entire `api-key-entries` block, instead of deleting the provider or writing an empty `api-key`/`label` placeholder.
- **Custom provider API-key editing** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `ProviderViewModel`, `MainWindow.axaml.cs`): editing an existing API key no longer shows the duplicate-key alert, label-only edits refresh the UI immediately, and clearing a label persists the empty label state back to `proxy-config.yaml`.
- **Quota account filtering** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `QuotaFetchService`): API-key accounts are excluded from OAuth quota views and refresh loops so they no longer collide with OAuth token lookup or appear as quota-capable accounts.

### Changed

- **Provider credentials source of truth** (`ConfigService`, `ProviderCatalogService`): upstream provider API keys, labels, base URLs, disabled custom providers, and OpenAI-compatible provider entries now round-trip through `proxy-config.yaml`; legacy `openai-compat-*.json` files are migrated and removed.
- **Provider/account display** (`ProviderViewModel`, `ProvidersView`): built-in providers now display as Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini; custom providers show their base URL on the provider row; API-key rows show the label with a masked `xxxx...yyyy` key underneath (or only the masked key when unlabeled); API-key credentials display as `N API key(s)`, OAuth credentials as `N connected account(s)`, and mixed providers as `N connected account(s) / N API key(s)`; per-key enable toggles are hidden for API-key credentials that CLIProxyAPI cannot disable individually.
- **Gemini provider scope** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `ConfigService`, `OAuthService`, `QuotaView`): Gemini support is now API-key-only via `gemini-api-key`; removed Gemini CLI OAuth/login, agent configuration, and quota UI paths after CLIProxyAPI dropped Gemini CLI support.
- **Unified alert/toast system** (`Themes/Brushes.axaml`, `Themes/Controls.axaml`, `Controls/ToastBehavior.cs`, `MainWindow`, `ConfigurationView`, `ProvidersView`, `MainWindowViewModel`): replaced the previous ad-hoc, semi-transparent banners with a single cohesive alert system — info / warning / error tonalities on solid surfaces with severity-colored icons and titles, larger padding and type, and consistent light/dark brushes. Every transient toast (provider status, configuration status such as a duplicate listen port, management-key-repaired, engine/app “no update available”, and the bottom-center app/engine “update available” notices) now uses this styling, stacks in a window-pinned region so it stays visible regardless of page scroll, fades in/out via the reusable `ctrl:Toast.IsOpen` behavior (animating opacity and collapsing from layout once hidden), and auto-dismisses where appropriate. Toasts were moved out of the scrollable provider/configuration views into shared window-level overlays and dismiss commands, removing the old inline banners and floating cards.

### Fixed

- **Quota fetch error states** (`QuotaFetchService`, `ProviderViewModel`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): quota providers now surface localized, actionable errors for missing tokens, expired authentication, rate limits, provider outages, and failed quota requests instead of silently leaving accounts in the generic "Quota not loaded" state.
- **System default language switch** (`LocalizationService`, `MainWindowViewModel`): switching from a manually-selected language back to **System default** now correctly follows the OS language. `SetCulture` mutates `CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture`, so resolving the system language from it returned the previously-selected override instead of the real OS culture. The OS UI culture is now captured once at process start (`LocalizationService.SystemCulture`) and used to resolve **System default**.
- **Provider row count localization** (`ProviderViewModel`, `Resources/Strings*.resx`): the provider sub-line (`N connected account(s)`, `N API key(s)`, and the mixed `… / …` form) now resolves through localized resources and refreshes on language change instead of showing hardcoded English.
- **Built-in Gemini provider actions** (`ProviderViewModel`, `ProviderCatalogService`): the edit-models and remove-provider buttons no longer appear on the built-in Gemini API-key provider — `IsCustomProvider` is now an explicit flag set only for user-added OpenAI-compatible providers instead of being inferred from API-key support.
- **Debug diagnostics startup** (`MainWindow.axaml.cs`): debug builds now initialize Avalonia diagnostics conditionally so release deployments do not require the diagnostics assembly.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **System language mode** (`LocalizationService`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the **Language** combo now includes **System default**; `Language: null` remains the explicit setting for following the current OS language, while selecting a specific locale stores that locale as a manual override.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Detected language persistence** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `SettingsService`): first-run system language detection is now saved to `settings.json` instead of leaving `Language` as `null`, keeping the selected **Language** combo and persisted settings in sync.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Additional UI languages** (`Resources/Strings.it-IT.resx`, `Strings.uk-UA.resx`, `Strings.ru-RU.resx`, `Strings.hi-IN.resx`, `Strings.ko-KR.resx`, `Strings.tr-TR.resx`, `Services/LocalizationService.cs`): added Italian, Ukrainian, Russian, Hindi, Korean, and Turkish translations to the **Language** combo, bringing the localized UI to 14 languages.

- **Runtime localization and language selector** (`Resources/Strings*.resx`, `Services/LocalizationService.cs`, `Services/LocExtension.cs`, `Views/*.axaml`): added runtime localization across the Avalonia UI for English, Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal), French, German, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic, including the new **Language** combo under Configuration → General → Theme, persisted language preference, localized formatted strings, provider/agent descriptions, tray popup, overlays, dialogs, and quota/provider views.

### Changed

- **Localization infrastructure** (`Resources/Strings*.resx`, `Services/LocExtension.cs`): replaced hardcoded UI text with `{l:Loc ...}` / `{l:LocFormat ...}` bindings backed by resx resources, with live refresh when the selected language changes.

- **Localized configuration combo boxes** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `ConfigurationView.axaml`): theme mode and routing strategy combo boxes now display localized labels while preserving their stored internal values.

- **Listen port editing** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `ConfigurationView.axaml`): the listen port is now edited as a draft and applied with an explicit **Apply** button (enabled only for a valid, changed port) instead of saving on every keystroke; the row is laid out as port, Apply, then Reset.

- **Engine update toast layout** (`Views/MainWindow.axaml`): the toast title can wrap to two lines so longer localized titles (for example Spanish) are not clipped.

### Fixed

- **Configuration update badge** (`MainWindowViewModel`): the orange update indicator now stays visible when any managed engine has an available update, instead of disappearing when switching focus to another engine tab.

- **Sliding tab localization refresh** (`Controls/SlidingTabBar.cs`): tab titles and tooltips now stay bound to their localized headers, so configuration tabs such as **General** update when the language changes.

- **Runtime localization gaps** (`LogsViewModel`, `QuotaFetchService`, `ProviderViewModel`): provider filters, quota reset countdowns, model selection labels, Chinese agent labels, and generated provider/agent texts now refresh correctly when the language changes.

- **Duplicate engine port** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `ConfigurationView.axaml`): applying a listen port already used by the other engine is now blocked and surfaces an error toast instead of silently allowing a conflict.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Tray usage popup primary action** (`Views/TrayUsagePopup.axaml`): **Open app** moved from the footer to the bottom of the left rail (always visible) as the popup's primary action, and **Configuration** moved to the footer, since opening the full app is the more common action.

- **Tray usage popup Home view** (`Views/TrayUsagePopup.axaml(.cs)`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the popup now opens on **Home**, which combines the engine status/controls with a **Usage** section below listing every connected provider and its quota usage (plan badge, usage bars, per-account and refresh-all controls), or a **No accounts to show** empty state when nothing is connected. The separate Usage rail button was dropped — the per-provider rail icons still drill into a single provider's quota. This makes Home a single at-a-glance dashboard and matches the main Quota window's empty state.

### Fixed

- **Tray usage popup forgetting the last view** (`Services/TrayService.cs`): the popup forced the **Home** view on every open, so switching to a provider's quota and reopening always reset to Home. The forced reset was removed; since the popup window and its `DataContext` are reused, it now reopens on the last viewed tab (Home or the selected provider), while still defaulting to Home on the first open after launch.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **App update toast dismiss button** (`MainWindowViewModel`): dismissing the "Tunnel Agent update available" toast now refreshes the computed visibility state immediately, so the toast hides when **Dismiss** is clicked.

- **Update toast stacking** (`MainWindow.axaml`): Tunnel Agent and engine update toasts now share the same bottom-center stack and width, so simultaneous update notices no longer overlap or appear misaligned.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **Tray menu labels simplified** (`Services/TrayService.cs`): removed trailing ellipses from **Show Usage** and **Configuration** for consistency with the rest of the tray menu.

- **Legacy root engine settings removed from settings output** (`AppSettings`, `SettingsService`): `ActiveEngineId`, root `Port`, and root `PreferredEngineVersion` are no longer written to `settings.json`; per-engine values in `Engines` are now the source of truth while old files still migrate on load.

### Fixed

- **Enter key in CLIProxyAPI key dialog** (`Views/ApiKeysOverlayView.axaml(.cs)`): pressing Enter in the add-key field now runs **Add key**, matching the button behavior.

- **Engine update toast follows detected engine** (`MainWindow`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the toast now captures the engine that raised the update notification, so switching between CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity no longer changes the version text or updates the wrong engine.

- **CLIProxyAPI management key auto-repair** (`LogsService`, `ConfigService`, `MainWindow`, `MainWindowViewModel`): when the management API rejects Tunnel Agent's key with 401/403, Tunnel Agent now rewrites `remote-management.secret-key` from `ManagementKey`, restarts CLIProxyAPI if it is running, and shows a short repaired toast.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Smooth crossfade animation for engine start/stop buttons** (`Views/ProvidersView.axaml`, `Views/TrayUsagePopup.axaml`, `Converters/Converters.cs`): the start and stop buttons now fade smoothly between each other using opacity transitions instead of instant visibility toggling. A new `ServerStateToOpacityConverter` controls the opacity based on server state, with `IsHitTestVisible` ensuring only the visible button is clickable.

- **Tray usage popup** (`Views/TrayUsagePopup.axaml(.cs)`, `Services/TrayService.cs`, `ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs`, `ViewModels/ProviderViewModel.cs`): an OpenUsage-style quota popup that opens from the tray icon (left-click on Windows, or the *Show Usage…* menu item) while the existing native right-click menu is preserved. It is a borderless, top-most, light-dismissed window positioned in the screen corner (bottom-right on Windows, top-right on macOS/Linux) and built entirely from the existing design tokens so it matches the main app. A left rail with a single animated accent indicator switches between a **Home** view and each connected provider; the **Home** view reuses the Providers window's engine status component (status dot + "Listening on port" + Start/Stop/Restart and a copy-endpoint chip) for CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity, and selecting a provider shows that provider's quota inline (per-account plan badge, usage bars and a per-account refresh button) without opening a separate window. The footer exposes an *Open app* door button, and the rail's gear opens the app directly on its Configuration section. The popup always opens on **Home**.

### Fixed

- **Gray square appearing behind engine action buttons when disabled** (`Themes/Controls.axaml`): the start/stop buttons showed an unwanted gray background square when their async commands were running (Starting state) due to missing `:disabled` style overrides. Added transparent background and preserved foreground colors for disabled engine action buttons.

- **Restart button in tray popup showing gray square when disabled** (`Views/TrayUsagePopup.axaml`): the restart button displayed a gray background square when disabled. Added `:disabled` styles to remove the background, change cursor to arrow, and prevent hover color changes.

- **Provider brand icons (OpenAI/Codex, xAI) invisible in the tray popup at startup** (`ProviderViewModel.cs`, `App.axaml.cs`, `Assets/providers/*.svg`): the monochrome brand glyphs relied on `currentColor` recoloured via `SvgImage.Css`, which (a) does not reliably recolour inherited fills in `Avalonia.Svg.Skia` and (b) threw when the icon was built during early startup (before the styling system was ready), leaving `SvgIcon` null so the rail fell back to initials. The SVGs now ship with an explicit `fill` (like the Agents icons) and are recoloured per theme via the proven CSS path, and the persisted theme variant is applied to the `Application` in `App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` *before* the view models build their icons so the correct colour is resolved from the first load.

### Changed

- **Plan badge positioning in tray popup quota accounts** (`Views/TrayUsagePopup.axaml`): the plan badge (Plus, Free, etc.) now appears to the left of the account name, matching the layout in the main app's Quota view.

- **Main window uses the tray popup's subtle rounded border** (`MainWindow.axaml.cs`): `ApplyNativeBorderColor` previously matched the native Windows 11 DWM border to the window background to hide it. It now paints the border with the `WinBorder` colour (`#1A1A1A` dark / `#D8DBE0` light) — the same brush the popup uses — so the window shows the same subtle rounded border, updated on theme change.

- **AppImage crashes on Linux due to incompatible native SkiaSharp library** (`TunnelAgent.Avalonia.csproj`): `Avalonia.Svg.Skia 11.3.0` pulled in `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux 2.88.9` (native v88) while the managed `SkiaSharp 3.116.1` expected a native library in the range `[116.0, 117.0)`, causing an `InvalidOperationException` at startup. An explicit `PackageReference` for `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux 3.116.1` now overrides the transitive dependency so both managed and native versions match.

- **Claude Code not detected when installed via snap** (`AgentCatalog.cs`): snap installs the binary as `claude-code` (`/snap/bin/claude-code`) instead of `claude`. Added `claude-code` to the binary names lookup list.

- **Double title bar on Linux** (`MainWindow.axaml.cs`): GNOME drew its own native title bar on top of the app's custom one because `SystemDecorations` was set to `Full`. Overriding to `SystemDecorations.None` on Linux removes the system-managed bar, leaving only the app's custom title bar.

- **AppImage crashes on Linux due to incompatible `Tmds.DBus.Protocol` version** (`TunnelAgent.Avalonia.csproj`): an explicit reference to `Tmds.DBus.Protocol 0.94.1` overrode the `0.21.3` version required by `Avalonia.FreeDesktop 11.3.17`, causing a `TypeLoadException` on `Connection` at startup. The explicit reference was removed so NuGet resolves the version Avalonia expects.

- **Portable Windows update creates duplicate launcher** (`release.yml`): the initial portable stub was named `Tunnel Agent.exe` (from `--packTitle "Tunnel Agent"`) but after auto-updating Velopack recreated it as `TunnelAgent.exe` (from `--packId`), leaving two launchers pointing to the same app. `--packTitle` for the Windows packaging step is now set to `TunnelAgent` to match the package ID.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Auto-refresh quota on first account added** (`ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`): when an OAuth provider transitions from having no accounts to having at least one, the quota for the new accounts is now fetched automatically in the background instead of waiting for the user to manually trigger a refresh.

- **Gemini interactive login dialog** (`GeminiLoginService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `MainWindow.axaml`, `ProvidersView.axaml.cs`): adding a Gemini account previously sent a blind delayed newline to stdin hoping the CLI would accept the default project — it failed silently for users whose token was already expired or who needed to choose a GCP project. The flow now runs the `cli-proxy-api -login` binary with redirected stdin/stdout and drives each interactive prompt from a purpose-built `GeminiLoginService` (modelled after `TokenGeneratorService`). A dedicated dialog walks through the three stages the CLI emits: (1) **Waiting for OAuth** — browser opens immediately, a progress bar stays visible while the user authenticates; (2) **Mode selection** — after OAuth completes, two clearly labelled buttons let the user pick *Code Assist* (manual GCP project) or *Google One* (personal account, auto-discover); (3) **Project selection** — for Code Assist, the project list returned by the CLI is parsed with a regex and displayed in a ListBox so the user can click to choose; success and error states are handled with appropriate banners and a Close/Cancel button that adapts its label. The old `SendDelayedNewlineAsync` workaround for `gemini-cli` in `OAuthService` is removed.

### Fixed

- **Provider toggle not enabled after first account added** (`ProviderCatalogService`): when a provider had no accounts and the first one was added, the toggle remained disabled. `OnAuthDirChanged` was only auto-disabling the toggle when accounts reached zero but never re-enabling it on the reverse transition. The previous connected state is now tracked so adding the first account enables the toggle, mirroring the existing disable-on-remove behaviour.

- **Quota fetch snapshot taken before accounts were synced** (`ProviderCatalogService`): the `ProviderFirstConnected` event was raised before `SyncOAuthAccounts` ran, so the account list was still empty when the quota handler snapshotted it. Newly-connected provider IDs are now collected during the loop and the events raised after all accounts are synced.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Pi: Claude thinking broken due to all models using `openai-completions` API** (`AgentConfigurationService.cs`): Tunnel Agent was generating a single `tunnel-agent-cliproxy` provider with `api: "openai-completions"` for all models, including Claude. Pi requires `api: "anthropic-messages"` for native thinking support on Anthropic models. The provider block is now split into two: `tunnel-agent-cliproxy` (`openai-completions`) for OpenAI/Codex models and `tunnel-agent-cliproxy-anthropic` (`anthropic-messages`) for Claude models, with the Anthropic base URL stripped of `/v1` to match the expected endpoint format.

- **Launch-at-login window stays visible instead of hiding to tray** (`App.axaml.cs`, `Program.cs`, `TrayService.cs`): when launched with `--start-in-tray` (launch at login), the main window appeared in the foreground and remained visible. Commit `713d6cf` had replaced `Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(Hide, Background)` with a synchronous `Hide()` to eliminate a micro-flash, but Avalonia internally queues a `Show()` when `desktop.MainWindow` is assigned. The synchronous `Hide()` ran before that pending `Show()`, so the framework later showed the window and it stayed visible. The fix skips `MainWindow` assignment at startup when `--start-in-tray` is present, assigns it dynamically on the first `ShowWindow()` call, and sets `ShutdownMode.OnExplicitShutdown` so the application does not exit when no windows are visible.

- **Claude quota missing reset time at 0%** (`QuotaFetchService`): when the `five_hour` or `seven_day` windows report `utilization: 0` and `resets_at: null`, the API means the window just reset and the session hasn't started yet. The UI was hiding the reset label because `FormatResetAtIso(null)` returned `""`. It now falls back to `UtcNow + 5h` for `five_hour` and `UtcNow + 7d` for `seven_day` so the label reads e.g. `"Resets in 4h 59m"` or `"Resets in 6d 23h"` instead of disappearing.

### Changed

- **Velopack autoupdate split by architecture** (`AppUpdateService`, `release.yml`): Velopack uses a single channel per OS by default (`win`, `linux`, `osx`), which cannot distinguish x64 from arm64. The release workflow now passes `--channel {rid}` to `vpk pack`, producing separate feeds (`releases.win-x64.json`, `releases.win-arm64.json`, etc.). `AppUpdateService` detects the current OS architecture at runtime and sets `UpdateOptions.ExplicitChannel` so the updater fetches the correct feed for the user's platform. Windows arm64 builds are now included in the release matrix. Linux and macOS channels are also split by architecture for consistency, though their existing installs will need to re-download once to migrate to the new channel-aware feeds.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Linux/macOS: persistent user environment variables** (`UserEnvironmentService`): on Unix, `EnvironmentVariableTarget.User` has no persistent backing store — variables were silently lost on restart. A new `IUserEnvironmentService` abstraction (in `TunnelAgent.Abstractions`) now drives platform-specific implementations: `WindowsUserEnvironmentService` retains the existing registry + `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` behaviour; `UnixUserEnvironmentService` persists through two layers: (1) an app-owned shell-sourceable file with `export KEY=VALUE` lines (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tunnelagent/environment` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/tunnelagent/environment` on macOS), read at startup via `Initialize()` to seed the process environment; (2) on Linux, a guarded block written once to `~/.profile` that sources that file — making variables available to all login sessions after the next login, removed automatically when the store is emptied; on macOS, a LaunchAgent plist (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tunnelagent.environment.plist`) that runs `launchctl setenv` for each variable at every login (`RunAtLoad: true`), combined with an immediate `launchctl setenv` call for the current GUI session. The existing static `UserEnvironmentService` facade is preserved so all call sites are unchanged.
- **Linux: XDG Base Directory compliance** (`IPlatformInfo`, `UnixUserEnvironmentService`): `LinuxPlatform.SettingsDirectory` was constructed as `~/.config/TunnelAgent` using `SpecialFolder.UserProfile` — bypassing `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when set. It now uses `SpecialFolder.ApplicationData`, which .NET resolves as `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (fallback `~/.config`). Same fix applied to the Unix environment store paths.
- **Perplexity engine: platform asset naming delegated to `IPlatformInfo`** (`IPlatformInfo`, `Perplexity/DownloadService`): `BuildAssetName` previously contained 15 lines of inline `OperatingSystem`/`RuntimeInformation` switches duplicating logic already present in `IPlatformInfo`. Two new interface members — `PerplexityBinaryName` and `PerplexityAssetSuffix` — are implemented per platform (`windows-amd64`, `macos-arm64`, `macos-26-intel`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-amd64`), and `BuildAssetName` is now a single line.
- **Agent detection: Unix well-known directories** (`AgentDetectionService`): `ScanWellKnownDirs` was only called on Windows, leaving macOS and Linux relying solely on `PATH` scan and `which`. It is now split into `ScanWellKnownDirsWindows` / `ScanWellKnownDirsUnix`. The Unix variant covers: `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.amp/bin`, `~/.volta/bin`, `~/.fnm`, `~/.nvm/current/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.local/share/pnpm`; plus `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` on macOS, and `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin`, `~/.linuxbrew/bin`, `/snap/bin`, Flatpak exports on Linux.
- **Agent detection: configured-env-var check on Unix** (`AgentDetectionService`): `IsConfiguredAsync` was reading `EnvironmentVariableTarget.User` which on Unix is equivalent to the process environment and does not read persisted values. It now delegates to `UserEnvironmentService.Get`, which reads from the app-owned store on Unix.
- **`DwmSetWindowAttribute` P/Invoke annotated** (`MainWindow`): the `dwmapi.dll` import lacked `[SupportedOSPlatform("windows")]`, preventing static CA1416 analysis and causing issues in AOT builds targeting Linux/macOS. The call site was already guarded by `IsWindowsVersionAtLeast` at runtime.
- **Startup UI loading reduced** (`MainWindow`, `ApiKeysOverlayView`, `AgentConfigOverlayView`): the main content area now creates section views lazily instead of instantiating Providers, Quota, Agents, Logs, and Configuration at startup. Heavy API keys and agent configuration overlays are also loaded on first use through lightweight hosts. Quota and agent data still warm in the background so navigation remains responsive while the initial visual tree is smaller.
- **Startup blocking work moved off UI thread** (`MainWindowViewModel`, `ConfigService`): settings loading, catalog initialization, Perplexity account migration, engine initialization, engine autostart, model fetching, and quota scanning were all running synchronously on the UI dispatcher before their first `await`, freezing the window at startup. They are now launched via `Task.Run` so the UI opens instantly. `ConfigService.BuildYaml` (file I/O + CPU-heavy string building) also runs on a background thread. A shared `ObserveStartupTaskAsync` helper logs background failures via `Trace.TraceWarning` without surfacing them to the user.
- **Fake-async methods rewritten to real async I/O** (`QuotaProviderService`, `ConfigService`, `ProviderCatalogService`, `MainWindowViewModel`): replaced `Task.FromResult` wrappers and synchronous file I/O with true async counterparts. `ScanAsync` now uses `SqliteConnection.OpenAsync`, `ExecuteReaderAsync`, `ReadAsync`, and `File.ReadAllTextAsync`. `ConfigService` readers (`ReadProviderSettingsFromConfig`, `ReadApiKeysFromConfig`, `ReadSecretKeyFromConfig`, `ReadExistingAmpUpstreamApiKey`) and `BuildYaml` are now async, using `File.ReadAllLinesAsync`. `ProviderCatalogService.InitializeAsync` awaits the config reader. ViewModel API-key and agent-config flows (`RefreshApiKeyItems`, `RemoveApiKeyAsync`, `PersistApiKeysAsync`, `OpenAgentConfigAsync`) propagate `await` through the stack. The `Task.Run` wrappers in callers are removed where the underlying method is now genuinely async.

### Fixed

- **Claude primary (5h) quota missing when at 0%** (`QuotaFetchService`): the `five_hour` usage window was being filtered out when `utilization` was 0 and `resets_at` was absent, even though the window exists for the account. The filter now only applies to sub-plan windows (`seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_sonnet`, `seven_day_omelette`) which indicate plan inclusions; `five_hour` and `seven_day` are always shown if present in the API response.
- **App update toast lacks dismiss button** (`MainWindow`, `MainWindowViewModel`): the Velopack self-update notification only offered "Download", forcing users to act or leave the toast permanently visible. A "Dismiss" button and `DismissAppUpdate` command now hide the toast; dismissal resets automatically on the next update check so fresh versions still surface.
- **Window flash on tray startup** (`App.axaml.cs`): when launched with `--start-in-tray` (auto-start), the main window was assigned to `desktop.MainWindow` and then hidden via `Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(..., DispatcherPriority.Background)`. The dispatcher queued the hide after the first render frame, causing a visible flash. The hide is now called synchronously immediately after window creation so the window never appears.
- **Memory growth and lifecycle cleanup** (`LogsViewModel`, `LogsService`, `MainWindowViewModel`, `TrayService`, engine process services): request logs are now capped in memory (pagination no longer hides an unbounded backing list), log polling only runs when the Logs section is visible, view/control event subscriptions are cleaned up on lifecycle changes, root services are disposed on exit, unhealthy engine processes are killed after failed health checks, Perplexity stderr/token buffers are bounded, and CA1416 platform analyzer warnings are resolved.
- **CS8826 warning in `ProviderViewModel`**: `OnQuotaFetchedEmptyChanged` partial method signature used `bool _` while the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm source generator emits `bool value`, causing a harmless but noisy signature-mismatch warning. Parameter renamed to match.

### Infrastructure

- **CI: build matrix extended to Linux and macOS** (`ci.yml`): the `build` job now runs on `windows-latest`, `ubuntu-latest`, and `macos-latest` in parallel with `fail-fast: false`. Build failures on any platform block the PR. NuGet cache is partitioned per OS.
- **Release: multi-platform packaging** (`release.yml`): the Windows-only monolith is replaced by a three-job pipeline. `prepare` resolves the version and waits for CI. `build` is a matrix over `win-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64` — each platform publishes, packages with Velopack, and uploads its artifacts. `publish` assembles the GitHub Release with all binaries and a unified `latest.json`. Linux packages as `.AppImage` (PNG icon). macOS packages as `.pkg` + `.zip` of the `.app` bundle (`.icns` icon). Version bump on Unix uses `sed` instead of PowerShell.
- **CI/CD runners updated** (`ci.yml`, `release.yml`): `windows-2025` was routing to the `windows-2025-vs2026` image with broken Visual Studio paths, causing jobs to freeze. Changed to `windows-latest` which points to the stable Windows Server 2025 image. `macos-13` (retired December 2025) replaced with `macos-15-intel` for x64 builds. `ubuntu-24.04-arm` partner runner replaced with `ubuntu-latest` for arm64 builds now that GitHub maintains native arm64 runners.
- **Release artifacts renamed with version and RID** (`release.yml`): Velopack generates flat names (`TunnelAgent.AppImage`, `TunnelAgent-osx-Setup.pkg`) that collide across platforms. The publish job now renames each artifact to include version and RID (`TunnelAgent-0.5.8-linux-x64.AppImage`, `TunnelAgent-0.5.8-osx-arm64.pkg`, etc.) so every binary has a unique name and the release table links correctly.
- **`logo.icns` added to assets**: generated once from `logo-256.png` using ImageMagick and committed to the repo. Velopack macOS packaging references it directly — no runtime icon generation in CI.
- **`OutputType` conditional on OS** (`TunnelAgent.Avalonia.csproj`): `WinExe` (suppresses console window) only when building on Windows; `Exe` on Linux/macOS where the distinction is meaningless.

### Tests

- **`UnixUserEnvironmentService` — 33 unit tests** (`UnixUserEnvironmentServiceTests`): full coverage of the app-owned store (get, set, remove, overwrite, multi-key, format, startup seeding), the Linux `~/.profile` hook (create, append, idempotency, no-trailing-newline edge case, source line content, clean-on-empty, preserve user content, trim trailing blank lines, full set→remove flow), and the macOS LaunchAgent plist (create, update, delete-when-empty, XML validity, label, XML/shell escaping of special characters, full set→remove flow). All tests use injected temp paths — no real home directory or system files are touched. Platform-guarded methods tested via `*Core()` variants, runnable on any OS including Windows CI.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **xAI quota tracking**: xAI (Grok) is now tracked in the Quota section. Fetches plan badge from `/settings` and credit usage from `/billing` via `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`. Token is automatically refreshed using the `refresh_token` from the cli-proxy-api auth file. Shows "No active Grok Build plan" state when no plan is active.

### Fixed

- **Quota tab bar overflowing with many providers**: tabs now show only the icon (no label) with a tooltip on hover, freeing enough space for all 8 providers without clipping. Icon size increased to 18×18 for better visibility.

- **Quota visible for CLIProxy-disabled accounts**: disabling an account in Providers (which sets `disabled: true` in the token file for CLIProxy routing) no longer hides it from the Quota view or prevents quota refresh. Quota and routing are now treated as independent concerns. `QuotaFetchService` no longer skips token files with `disabled: true`. The "disabled" badge is hidden in the Quota view. Quota account lists and refresh no longer filter by `IsDisabled`.
- **Plan badge reset on provider sync**: `SyncOAuthAccounts` was unconditionally overwriting `PlanBadge` with the raw value from `OAuthTokenDetector` (e.g. `PLUS`) on every auth-dir change, discarding the richer Pascal Case value previously set by `QuotaFetchService`. It now only sets the badge as a fallback when the account has no existing value.
- **Plan badge casing from token file always uppercase**: `OAuthTokenDetector` was returning plan strings via `ToUpperInvariant()` from both the JSON `plan` field and the filename suffix. It now applies `ToPlanBadge()` normalisation at the source, producing consistent Pascal Case (`Plus`, `Pro`) regardless of fetch path.
- **Plan badge pop when expanding a provider in Providers view**: `WireEvents` was triggering a full `FetchAndApplyAsync` on every expand, causing the badge to flash as the API response overwrote the existing value. Quota fetch is no longer tied to the expand gesture; it only happens at startup, on Quota section navigation, and on manual refresh.
- **Cursor, Kiro and Trae quota not loaded on startup**: `ScanQuotaProvidersAsync` and `RefreshAllQuotaProvidersAsync` were fired as independent fire-and-forget tasks, so the refresh often ran before the scan had populated `StandaloneQuotaProviders`. They are now sequenced via `ScanAndRefreshQuotaAsync` at startup. Quota is fetched automatically in the background on launch without requiring manual refresh.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **xAI provider support**: xAI (Grok) is now available as an OAuth provider alongside the rest. Includes login via `--xai-login`, token file detection, custom Grok logo, and correct "OAuth" auth kind label in Available Models.
- **Removed unused SVG assets**: `cursor-agent.svg` (leftover from when Cursor was an agent) and `kimi.svg` (Kimi uses an inline path in `ProviderIconRegistry`) have been deleted.

### Fixed

- **Refresh buttons show grey background on press**: quota, agents, and logs refresh buttons now use `Click` handler instead of `Command` binding, preventing the automatic disable state that caused a grey square to appear during execution. The spin icon already provides visual feedback. All three buttons now use the `icon` style for consistent appearance.
- **Plan badge inconsistent casing**: all providers now use title-case for plan badges (e.g. `PRO` → `Pro`, `PLUS` → `Plus`). A `ToPlanBadge` helper normalises any API string word-by-word. Kiro's `KIRO FREE` / `KIRO PRO` prefix is stripped since the provider name is already shown in the UI, leaving just `Free` / `Pro`.
- **Cursor plan badge missing**: `FetchCursorAsync` now calls `GetPlanInfo` to retrieve `planName` (e.g. `Pro`, `Ultra`) and sets it as the plan badge on each refresh.
- **Gemini CLI hides quota groups not included in plan**: groups with `remainingFraction=0` and no reset date (epoch `1970-01-01` treated as null) are now hidden — this indicates the plan does not include the model tier, not that the quota is exhausted.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Gemini CLI quota aligned with Quotio spec**: `loadCodeAssist` now called first to extract plan badge (`paidTier` takes priority over `currentTier`). Quota groups restructured to three tiers: `Gemini Flash Lite`, `Gemini Flash`, and `Gemini Pro`, each with preferred model IDs per Quotio's group definitions. `_vertex` model ID suffix stripped. `resetTime` of `1970-01-01` (epoch) treated as no data. Buckets with null `remainingFraction` are skipped.
- **Copy All copies raw content for single-file configs**: filename and path headers are now only prepended when copying multiple config files at once (e.g. Codex `config.toml` + `auth.json`); single-file configs copy the raw content directly.
- **Select All checkbox is now two-state**: the indeterminate third state added no value and made the toggle confusing; it now cycles between checked and unchecked only.
- **Antigravity quota aligned with OpenUsage/Quotio spec**: `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` is now tried first with `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` as fallback. Model bars now use `displayName` from the API response instead of regex grouping, giving accurate per-model labels (e.g. `Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Thinking)`, `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)`). Internal models (`isInternal: true`) and models with empty `displayName` are filtered out. Duplicate display names are deduplicated keeping the lowest `remainingFraction`. Gemini 2.x model IDs blacklisted as they duplicate newer entries. `loadCodeAssist` is now called first to obtain the `cloudaicompanionProject` ID, which is passed to `fetchAvailableModels` — without it the API returns integer `1` for all fractions; with it real usage fractions are returned. Plan badge derived from `currentTier.id` (`free-tier` → `Free`, etc.). Models with `null` `remainingFraction` (e.g. Claude/GPT on free plan) are hidden rather than shown as 0%.
- **Codex quota aligned with OpenUsage spec**: `ChatGPT-Account-Id` header now sent when available (improves quota accuracy). `code_review_rate_limit` window added as a bar when present. `credits` balance shown in plan badge when `has_credits=true`. Email populated from API response. Proactive token refresh when `last_refresh` > 8 days or near expiry; reactive refresh on 401/403. Token refresh uses `POST auth.openai.com/oauth/token` with form-encoded body per spec.
- **Claude quota aligned with OpenUsage spec**: added `seven_day_opus`, `seven_day_sonnet`, and `seven_day_omelette` rate-limit windows (plan-dependent, optional); windows with `utilization=0` and no `resets_at` are hidden. `extra_usage` overage is shown in the plan badge only when `used_credits > 0`. `subscriptionType` from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is used as the plan badge. Proactive token refresh 5 minutes before expiry; reactive refresh on 401/403.
- **Trae shows wrong quota metrics for dollar-based plans**: the API response includes `is_dollar_usage_billing: true` for free-tier accounts, which use `basic_usage_amount`/`basic_usage_limit` (dollar spend) and `auto_completion_limit` — not Premium Fast/Slow or Advanced Models. The fetcher now branches on this flag and displays `Free plan ($x.xx/$y.00)` and `Autocomplete` bars instead.
- **Trae username not shown on Windows**: `ReadTraeTokenFromLogs` now also extracts `userName` from `userInfoChange` log lines and uses it as the account identifier when no email is available from `storage.json`.
- **Hide Sensitive Info does not mask non-email identifiers**: `MaskEmailAddress` only masked values containing `@`, leaving opaque IDs (e.g. Kiro `userId`) fully visible. Non-email values are now masked as first 4 characters followed by bullets.
- **Kiro live API request always failing when token expired**: `User-Agent` header containing commas (`m/N,E`) caused `Headers.Add()` to throw `FormatException` silently aborting the entire request. Fixed with `TryAddWithoutValidation`. `nextDateReset` in the live API response is a JSON float (e.g. `1.782864E9`, unix seconds), not a string — now correctly parsed and converted to ISO 8601. `currentUsageWithPrecision` / `usageLimitWithPrecision` are now preferred over the truncated integer fields when present.
- **Kiro quota aligned with OpenUsage spec**: auth token field names corrected to camelCase (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`) matching the observed `kiro-auth-token.json` shape. Added `profile.json` fallback for `profileArn`. `ScanKiro` and `FetchKiroAsync` now read Kiro's SQLite usage cache (`state.vscdb` → `kiro.resourceNotifications.usageState`) first, enrich plan title and overage status from the latest `q-client.log` `GetUsageLimitsCommand` response, and only fall back to the live API when the local snapshot is missing or stale (>10 min). `subscriptionInfo.subscriptionTitle` is applied as the plan badge; `overageConfiguration.overageStatus` is appended. Auth-mode headers (`TokenType: EXTERNAL_IDP`, `redirect-for-internal`) are sent for non-social accounts. Social token refresh URL fixed to always use `us-east-1`. Local and live API breakdown shapes unified in `ParseKiroBreakdownList`.
- **Trae quota aligned with Quotio**: entitlement fallback now uses the first item in `user_entitlement_pack_list` when none has `status == 1`. `product_type` mapping corrected (`0`→`"Free"`, `1`→`"Pro"`, `2`→`"Team"`, `3`→`"Builder"`); unknown types no longer show a misleading `"FREE"` badge.
- **Trae auth on Windows**: `storage.json` values are Electron `safeStorage`-encrypted on Windows and cannot be decrypted outside the Electron process. `ScanTrae` and `FetchTraeAsync` now try plain JSON parse first (works on macOS) and fall back to scanning the most recent `completion.log` for a `Cloud-IDE-JWT` bearer token when the value is encrypted.
- **Cursor quota not detected**: `Immutable=True` is not supported by `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` and was silently throwing an exception inside the `catch {}` block, causing `ScanCursor` and `FetchCursorAsync` to always return not-detected. Replaced with `Mode=ReadOnly`.

### Removed

- **Quota tab removed from Providers**: the "Quota" tab and embedded Quota Providers panel (Cursor, Kiro, Trae) have been removed from the Providers section. Cursor, Kiro, and Trae remain exclusively in the Quota window.

### Added

- **Cursor in Providers → Quota**: Cursor is now detected via `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb` (SQLite) and shown alongside Kiro and Trae in the Quota section. Quota usage (plan requests and on-demand) is fetched from `POST https://api2.cursor.sh/aiserver.v1.DashboardService/GetCurrentPeriodUsage` using the stored bearer token, with automatic token refresh via the OAuth refresh token.
- **Kiro added to IDE Quota Tracking**: Kiro now appears in the Quota SlidingTabBar alongside Cursor and Trae.

### Removed

- **Cursor Agent removed from agent configuration**: Cursor is an IDE, not a CLI agent. It has been removed from the agents catalog and all related shell-export configuration logic. It is now correctly placed in Providers → Quota (monitor-only).

### Fixed

- **`ModelEntry.ApiKey` stores raw env var name**: API key references in `ModelEntry` are now stored as plain variable names (e.g. `TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY`) and each agent's config builder applies its own format — OpenCode wraps with `{env:VAR}`, Droid and Pi wrap with `${VAR}`. Previously, the OpenCode format was applied at creation time and incorrectly propagated to all agents.
- **Fallback preview shows env var reference instead of raw key**: when the engine is not running and no models are selected, the manual config preview for OpenCode, Pi, and Factory Droid now shows the environment variable placeholder (`{env:TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY}` / `${TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY}`) instead of the raw API key value.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Logs dashboard**: added a dedicated Logs section with Requests and Proxy Logs tabs, toolbar actions, search, provider filtering, CSV/log export, and Quotio-inspired dark UI styling.
- **Requests history**: Requests now show parsed CLIProxyAPI traffic with full timestamps (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`), newest-first ordering, provider labels, status badges, latency, search, provider filtering, and 25-entry pagination over the full in-memory history.
- **Proxy Logs view**: raw CLIProxyAPI logs are shown in a dedicated tab with search and a 100-line cap for performance.
- **Management API + file fallback for logs**: Logs use `GET /v0/management/logs` while CLIProxyAPI is running and fall back to reading local `main.log` when the server is stopped; manual refresh works in both modes.
- **Log actions**: refresh triggers a manual poll with a spin animation, the eraser clears the in-memory view, downloads export Requests as CSV and Proxy Logs as `.log`, and the trash action deletes the underlying log file with a global confirmation dialog.
- **Logs auto-refresh settings**: added CLIProxy configuration controls for enabling/disabling logs auto-refresh and selecting the polling interval; auto-refresh is disabled by default.
- **CLIProxy management key support**: generated and persisted a UUID-style management key and wrote `remote-management.secret-key` plus `logging-to-file: true` into the CLIProxy config.

### Fixed

- **CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity credential updates**: adding, setting default, or removing credentials now runs environment-variable writes off the UI thread while clearing both user and process values, preventing stale defaults from being re-added during refresh.
- **OpenCode apiKey env placeholders**: OpenCode provider configuration now writes API keys with `{env:ENV_VARIABLE}` placeholders instead of shell-style `${ENV_VARIABLE}` placeholders.
- **Model selector always shown in bulk agent config**: opening the multi-agent configuration dialog no longer inherits the hidden model selector state from a previously opened single-agent dialog (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Amp).

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **Agent icons in config popup follow theme**: the configuration popup (single-agent summary and bulk agent picker) now uses the theme-aware `Icon` property instead of the static `SvgImageConverter`, so OpenCode, Pi, Factory Droid, and Cursor Agent icons correctly switch between dark and light fills when the theme changes.
- **Single instance: debug and release no longer share mutex**: the mutex and named pipe used for single-instance enforcement now use distinct names in debug builds (`-Debug` suffix), preventing a debug session from activating the release instance and vice versa.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Single instance enforcement**: launching a second instance of the app while one is already running now brings the existing window to the front (restoring it if minimized or hidden to tray) instead of opening a duplicate window.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **App update download progress**: clicking "Download" in the app update toast now navigates to the General settings section and shows a progress bar while downloading. Previously there was no feedback and the download happened silently in the background.
- **App update applies automatically**: once the download completes the update is applied and the app restarts without requiring a second button press.
- **Configuration badge on app update**: the orange dot on the Configuration sidebar item now also appears when a Tunnel Agent app update is available, not only when an engine update is pending.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Sidebar collapse/expand animations**: smooth width transition (220ms `CubicEaseInOut`) when toggling the sidebar, with a fade out/in effect (180ms) on all text labels, badges, and status indicators. The toggle button icon flips horizontally with a 220ms scale transition instead of swapping between two separate icons.
- **Configuration badge**: update dot replaced with an animated pulse indicator (matching the engine status style) using `WarnBrush` (orange) for visibility in both selected and unselected states.

- **Dark theme**: Vercel-inspired pure black backgrounds (`#000000` window, `#0A0A0A` sidebar, `#111111` cards) with subtle `#1A1A1A` borders, replacing the previous blue-grey palette.
- **Agent icon theme-aware rendering**: OpenCode, Pi, Factory Droid, and Cursor Agent SVG icons (which have black fills) now automatically invert to white in dark mode and revert to black in light mode via CSS injection (`path { fill: ... }`). Updates live when the theme is switched without restarting.

- **Engine auto-start**: each engine (CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity WebUI Scraper) now has an "Auto-start" toggle in its ENGINE settings card. When enabled, the engine starts automatically on app launch. The setting is persisted per-engine in `settings.json` under `Engines[].AutoStart`.

- **Amp CLI agent support**: full integration including binary detection (`~/.amp/bin/amp.exe` on Windows), automatic configuration of `~/.config/amp/settings.json` (`amp.url`) and `~/.local/share/amp/secrets.json` (`apiKey@url`), access token field with eye icon in the config dialog, and `ampcode` block written directly to `proxy-config.yaml` (`upstream-url` + `upstream-api-key`).
- **Amp CLI model selector hidden**: Amp manages its own models internally; no model multiselect shown in the config dialog.
- **Amp access token preserved on yaml regeneration**: `ConfigService` reads the existing `upstream-api-key` from `proxy-config.yaml` and preserves it whenever the config is regenerated, even if not stored in `settings.json`.
- **Agent config confirmation paths on separate lines**: multiple config file paths now display one per line instead of joined with `+`.

### Fixed

- **Update success banner scoped per engine**: updating or installing a specific version of one engine (CLIProxyAPI or Perplexity) no longer shows the "Successfully updated" banner on both configuration tabs simultaneously. Each tab now tracks its own success state independently.
- **Engine update toast shown on startup for any engine**: the "update available" notification at the bottom of the screen now appears for both CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity regardless of which config tab is focused. Previously the toast was only triggered for the currently focused engine, so updates detected on the background engine were silently ignored.

- **CLIProxy API keys and default key removed from `settings.json`**: keys are now stored exclusively in `proxy-config.yaml` (`api-keys:`) and the default key in the `TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY` user environment variable. One-time migration runs on startup to move legacy keys from `settings.json` to the yaml.
- **`TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY` read from user environment registry**: `UserEnvironmentService.Get` now reads from `EnvironmentVariableTarget.User` first, so the variable is detected in the same session it was set without requiring a restart.
- **First CLIProxy API key automatically set as default**: adding the first key (or any key when no default is set) now automatically marks it as default and sets the env var.
- **CLIProxy API key visible in popup on startup**: env var key missing from yaml is automatically added to keep both in sync.

- **Amp `secrets.json` always written**: previously skipped when no CLIProxy API key was configured; now always written with `no-key` as fallback so Amp does not start the OAuth login flow.
- **Amp access token not stored in `settings.json`**: the `upstream-api-key` is written and read directly from `proxy-config.yaml`, avoiding redundant storage of a sensitive value.

### Changed

- **Traffic-light buttons**: icons (−, ⤢, ×) now fade in on hover using a custom `ControlTemplate` with a `Border` opacity transition (150ms).
- **Gemini CLI agent configuration**: apply now saves `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` as persistent user environment variables (instead of showing a manual shell export). Revert removes both variables. On Windows, `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` is broadcast so newly spawned processes pick up the change.
- **Gemini CLI configured detection**: uses `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` env var presence to detect whether the agent is configured.

### Fixed

- **Quota tab navigation**: switching between any provider tab (including Kiro and Trae) now correctly updates the content view. Kiro/Trae are registered as `ProviderViewModel` placeholders when not yet detected, keeping navigation consistent with all other providers.
- **Edit Perplexity label dialog**: Escape and Enter now work regardless of focus; clicking outside the dialog closes it.

### Changed

- **Pi agent icon**: changed from white to black.
- **README**: added Windows-only warning with note welcoming cross-platform contributions, fixed engine section headers to link to their respective repositories, updated Usage section to reflect automatic engine installation on startup and clarified agent configuration flow.
- **README**: removed GitHub Copilot from the supported providers table; corrected Codex, Kimi, and Antigravity auth method from API key to OAuth.
- **GitHub Copilot removed**: dropped all Copilot support from code and UI — the `--github-copilot-login` flag does not exist in CLIProxy.
- **Traffic-light buttons hover**: replaced the grey Avalonia default hover with a color-preserving style that keeps the circle color and fades in the icon.
- **Gemini CLI proxy variables**: switched from `CODE_ASSIST_ENDPOINT` to `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` + `GEMINI_API_KEY` (API key mode), matching the CLIProxyAPI documentation.
- **Gemini CLI**: model selector hidden in agent config dialog (Gemini CLI only supports Gemini models via the proxy).

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Factory Droid `displayName`**: resolved from OpenRouter `name` field (provider prefix stripped), with local formatting fallback. All models include `(Tunnel Agent)` suffix; Perplexity models include `(Tunnel Agent - Perplexity)`.
- **Pi two-provider split**: `tunnel-agent-cliproxy` and `tunnel-agent-perplexity` providers written to `models.json` with correct `baseUrl`, `apiKey` (env var refs), and per-model `name`, `contextWindow`, and `input` fields.
- **OpenCode two-provider split**: `tunnel-agent-cliproxy` and `tunnel-agent-perplexity` providers written to `opencode.json` using `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, with `litellmProxy: true`, env var `apiKey` refs, and per-model `name`.
- **Perplexity models in agent config**: when the Perplexity engine is running, its models now appear in the agent configuration dialog alongside CLIProxy models.
- **`TUNNEL_AGENT_PERPLEXITY_TOKEN` env var**: automatically set/updated/removed in user environment variables when a Perplexity account is added, set as default, or removed. Factory Droid config uses `${TUNNEL_AGENT_PERPLEXITY_TOKEN}` instead of the raw session token.
- **`TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY` env var**: automatically set/updated/removed when the default CLIProxy API key changes. Factory Droid config uses `${TUNNEL_AGENT_CLIPROXY_API_KEY}` instead of the raw key.
- On Windows, `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` is broadcast after env var changes so newly spawned processes pick up the new values without logoff.
- **Claude Code**: `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` written to `~/.claude/settings.json` env block. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` no longer includes `/v1`.

### Changed

- **Dual engine model fetch**: `ActiveEngine`/`ActiveEngineId` removed — each engine (`CliProxy`, `Perplexity`) now maintains its own independent model collection and fetch lifecycle. Both engines can be running and serving models simultaneously.
- **Providers model list**: now shows only the models of the currently selected engine tab instead of a combined list.
- **Factory Droid Perplexity models**: now use the correct Perplexity engine endpoint (`http://127.0.0.1:8327/v1`) instead of the CLIProxy endpoint.
- **Codex CLI config**: writes `config.toml` with `model_provider = "cliproxyapi"` and `wire_api = "responses"`, plus `auth.json` with `auth_mode: "apikey"` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Both files shown in the apply result.
- **Codex CLI**: model selector hidden in agent config dialog (Codex only supports one model at a time, selected at runtime).
- **Claude Code**: model selector hidden in agent config dialog (uses alias-based model selection at runtime).
- Models expander label no longer uses an emdash (`Models N of N selected`).

### Fixed

- Models in agent config dialog were empty on open if engines were already running before the dialog was opened.
- UI no longer freezes when adding, removing or changing the default CLIProxy API key or Perplexity account — env var writes and `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` broadcast now run on a background thread.
- UI no longer freezes when navigating to the Agents section — SVG icons now load on the UI thread at background priority, and binary/config detection runs entirely on the thread pool.
- GitHub releases now correctly show "What's Changed", contributors and "Full Changelog" sections.
- Release workflow now always commits the version bump back to `main` (previously skipped when triggered from CHANGELOG).

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).
- **Pi input modalities**: `input` is now written per-model based on OpenRouter's `input_modalities` — `["text", "image"]` for vision-capable models, `["text"]` for text-only.
- **Pi preview**: the manual preview now also resolves `contextWindow` and `input` from OpenRouter, so what you see matches what Apply writes.

### Fixed

- **Factory Droid config**: config file corrected to `~/.factory/settings.json` (was `config.json`), field names updated to camelCase (`displayName`, `baseUrl`, `apiKey`), and provider changed to `generic-chat-completion-api` per official docs.
- **Factory Droid provider inference**: provider is now resolved from the model's `owned_by` field (from `/v1/models`) — `anthropic` (with `/v1` stripped) for Anthropic models, `openai` for OpenAI models, `generic-chat-completion-api` for everything else.
- **Factory Droid apiKey**: `apiKey` is now always written (using `"no-key"` as fallback) since Factory Droid requires the field.
- **Agent config dialog**: dialog height is now `MaxHeight` instead of fixed, so it shrinks to fit content after applying.
- **Dialog keyboard shortcuts**: Escape closes and Enter confirms in the Agent Config, Manage Keys, and Add Perplexity Account dialogs.
- **Dialog focus**: dialogs now receive focus automatically on open so keyboard shortcuts work immediately without clicking first.
- **Click outside to close**: clicking the backdrop now closes the Agent Config, Manage Keys, and Add Perplexity Account dialogs.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **App update UI**: Configuration → General now shows the installed Tunnel Agent version, a "Check" button, and a toggle for auto-check on startup.
- **Update toast**: a non-blocking toast appears when a new Tunnel Agent version is available, with "Download" and "Restart & Install" actions.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Scoop bucket now uses the portable zip instead of the installer — simpler install with no UAC prompt.
- `latest.json` release asset now includes the portable zip hash (`portable.sha256`) alongside the installer hash.
- Section spacing in Configuration → General matches the CLIProxy section.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Scoop bucket support — `scoop bucket add villoh https://github.com/Villoh/scoop-bucket` then `scoop install villoh/tunnel-agent`.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- App name corrected to "Tunnel Agent" (with space) in installer, GitHub Releases title, and all user-visible UI strings.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- CI test suite now runs on Ubuntu (faster, cheaper) with Windows reserved for the build and release jobs.
- Platform-specific tests (`Win32Exception`, binary path `.exe`) correctly skip on Linux instead of failing.
- Blocking `GetAwaiter().GetResult()` calls in tests replaced with `async/await` (xUnit1031).
- `QuotaProviderCount` tests updated to match current account-based semantics.
- Unused `[Theory]` parameters removed from `EngineService_ServerState_MapsCorrectly` (xUnit1026).
- CI runner pinned to `windows-2025` to avoid GitHub's `windows-latest` redirect notice.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot username display**: reads the `username` field from `github-copilot-*.json` auth files so accounts show the GitHub username instead of falling back to filename parsing.
- **Hide sensitive information** setting in Configuration → General: masks all account email addresses with bullet dots (`•••@•••`) to keep them private on shared screens.
- **Quota view**: dedicated sidebar section to track quota usage for CLIProxyAPI providers (Claude, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity) and standalone IDE accounts (Kiro, Trae).
- **Quota providers tab** in Providers view: read-only tab showing detected standalone quota providers (Kiro, Trae) that are not managed by CLIProxyAPI or Perplexity.
- **Gemini CLI quota fetching**: direct API calls to `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota` with OAuth token refresh support.
- **Antigravity quota fetching**: direct API calls to `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:fetchAvailableModels` with OAuth token refresh support.
- **Kiro quota fetching**: direct API calls to AWS CodeWhisperer usage API with Social/IdC token refresh support.
- **Trae quota fetching**: direct API calls to Trae entitlement API with Cloud-IDE-JWT authentication.
- **Custom SVG icons**: `SlidingTabBar` now supports `CustomIconData` property for SVG path rendering; `ProviderIconRegistry` includes custom icons for Antigravity, Kiro, and Trae.
- **Global quota refresh**: single refresh button in Quota view header refreshes all providers with active accounts.
- **Initial quota load**: Quota view auto-loads quota data on first open if accounts exist but no data is loaded.
- Agents page with CLI tool detection, installed/configured state, SVG icons, documentation links, individual setup, and multi-agent setup.
- Agent configuration support for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Amp, OpenCode, Pi, Factory Droid, Cursor Agent, and Aider.
- Model picker in the Agents setup dialog with search, tri-state select-all for visible results, and dynamic manual config previews.
- CLIProxyAPI key management UI with optional default key selection, removable keys, and generated agent configs that omit auth when no default key exists.
- Eye/eye-off reveal toggles for CLIProxy API key, custom provider API key, and Perplexity session token inputs.
- SVG agent assets for Amp, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, Factory Droid, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Pi.

### Changed

- **GitHub Copilot quota fetching**: fixed API response parsing to use the real field structure (`quota_snapshots.{chat,completions,premium_interactions}` with `percent_remaining`/`remaining`/`entitlement`; `limited_user_quotas`+`monthly_quotas` for Free/Individual plans); added reset date from `quota_reset_date_utc`; corrected plan badge detection via `copilot_plan`+`access_type_sku`; updated request headers to `Accept: application/vnd.github+json` + `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28`.
- **Quota UI moved** from Providers account cards to dedicated Quota view; Providers now focuses solely on account management (add/remove/enable/disable/connect/disconnect).
- **Quota refresh policy**: tab switching no longer triggers refresh; explicit refresh actions (global button, per-account button) or initial load only.
- **Shorter tab labels**: "GitHub Copilot" → "Copilot", "Gemini CLI" → "Gemini" to fit 7 tabs in Quota view.
- **Provider icon colors**: Kiro uses `#9046FF` (Kiro purple), Trae uses `#32F08C` (Trae green), Antigravity uses `#7C3AED` with custom butterfly icon.
- **icon-btn style**: added `Foreground` setter using `FgBrush` and `:pressed` state for consistent button feedback.
- Agents detection now runs in the background, uses parallel detection, and exposes a compact spinning refresh action.
- Agents setup now uses icon-only gear actions for single and bulk configuration.
- OpenCode, Pi, and Factory Droid setup now register selected models dynamically instead of relying on static model slots.
- Factory Droid config now writes `customModels` entries per model and migrates legacy `custom_models` entries.
- OpenCode config now omits hardcoded context/output/vision limits and lets OpenCode use provider/model defaults.
- CLIProxy API keys are now optional: empty key list means no `api-keys` entry in `proxy-config.yaml` and no bearer header from Tunnel Agent.
- `settings.json` no longer persists provider/runtime state (`Providers`, `PerplexityAccounts`); provider intent is loaded from `proxy-config.yaml` where practical and credentials remain file-backed.
- Agents setup dialogs use improved scrolling, spacing, and compact controls.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- **Qwen provider removed**: CLIProxyAPI upstream does not support Qwen; removed from built-in OAuth providers, login flags, token detection, and documentation.
- **Refresh button visibility**: global refresh button now visible with proper icon styling.
- **icon-btn click feedback**: added `:pressed` pseudo-class styling to prevent default Fluent button background flash.
- `/v1/models` health and model fetch requests now include the selected default CLIProxy bearer token when CLIProxy auth is enabled.
- Available models now keep polling after CLIProxy health passes, covering startup races while auth/models are still loading.
- Manual Agents config previews refresh when available models load while the dialog is already open.
- CLIProxy `proxy-config.yaml` API key output no longer corrupts YAML formatting.
- Amp setup now writes `settings.json` plus `secrets.json` using the base URL without `/v1`.
- Codex setup now writes both `config.toml` and `auth.json`.
- Secret input dialogs no longer retain cancelled API keys when reopened.
- Legacy settings migration avoids stripping `Providers` and `PerplexityAccounts` before migration consumers can run.
- Agent detection speed: PATH and well-known directories are scanned first (no subprocess); `where.exe`/`which` is used only as a fallback; binary name candidates are checked in parallel; `$PATH` split is computed once at startup.
- Pi `baseUrl` now correctly includes `/v1` in the generated `models.json`.
- Pi and OpenCode `apiKey` field always written; uses `"no-key"` placeholder when CLIProxy auth is disabled so provider schemas that require a non-empty key do not reject the config.
- Pi provider key in `models.json` renamed from `cliproxy` to `tunnel-agent` for consistency with OpenCode.
- Pi config path corrected to `~/.pi/agent/models.json`.
- All agent config files written as UTF-8 without BOM; prevents JSON parse errors in runtimes that do not strip the BOM.
- `ApplyAgentConfigAsync` finally block dispatched to UI thread; fixes unhandled `InvalidOperationException` (`Call from invalid thread`) when applying agent config.
- Start/stop engine-action button colours restored after `icon-btn` `Foreground` override introduced a style-specificity conflict.
- Quota sidebar badge now counts providers with at least one active account instead of all quota-supported providers.
- Agent configure tooltip translated to English (`"Configurar"` → `"Configure"`, `"Reconfigurar"` → `"Reconfigure"`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Supported Ecosystem section in README listing AI providers and a placeholder for future agent integration.
- App Data Storage section in README documenting paths for engine binaries and application settings.
- Auth File Storage section in README documenting paths for CLIProxyAPI OAuth tokens and Perplexity session tokens.
- `SettingsService.LoadSync()` for synchronous settings read at startup to prevent flash-of-wrong-theme before the window is shown.

### Changed

- Brand accent colour updated to `#146CF9` (extracted from the logo) across light and dark themes, replacing the previous `#0A84FF` / `#4DA3FF`.
- Primary button text stays white on hover in light mode; Fluent template no longer overrides foreground on pointer-over.
- Horizontal scroll disabled on the main content area (`HorizontalScrollBarVisibility="Disabled"`); the app layout is fully vertical and horizontal scrolling was never intentional.
- Default window size changed to 820×620; minimum size set to 600×500.
- README hero updated to reference both CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity WebUI Scraper with direct links.
- README badges moved above navigation links.
- Credits rewritten as a concise bullet list; perplexity-webui-scraper added.
- `Build from Source` section renamed to `Development` with a single code block instead of a numbered list.
- Em-dashes replaced with colons, semicolons, and commas throughout README and CONTRIBUTING.
- SECURITY.md updated: supported versions table now shows 0.3.x as the only supported release; reporting instructions link directly to the GitHub private advisory form.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Flash-of-wrong-theme on startup when light mode is saved: settings are now read synchronously before the window is created so `RequestedThemeVariant` is applied before the first render.

### Added

- Perplexity engine controls in the system tray alongside CLIProxyAPI, including status, start, stop, and restart actions.
- Inline token generator in the Add Perplexity Account modal: email → OTP → optional TOTP (three-step wizard, Step 1–3 of 3).
- TOTP (two-factor authentication) support in the token generator flow, compatible with the updated perplexity-webui-scraper fork.
- Email validation before sending OTP request; invalid email shows a contextual styled error inside the modal.
- TOTP code validation (6-digit check) before sending the authenticator code.
- Enter key advances the token wizard steps and saves the account from the manual Session Token form.
- Contextual styled error alert for token generation failures with friendly guidance (2FA / manual cookie fallback).
- Edit label button (pencil icon) on Perplexity session account rows, with a modal dialog and Enter-to-save support.

### Changed

- README now documents the multi-engine architecture, first-class Perplexity support, and engine-specific account storage.
- Providers view server action now uses compact play/stop icon buttons instead of text buttons.
- Copy-endpoint and engine action buttons now use subtler hover/press transitions.
- Add Perplexity Account modal: label field moved above session token field.
- Token generator step labels changed from "Step N of 2" to "Step N of 3" to reflect the optional TOTP third step.
- SlidingTabBar tab text uses FgBrush (theme-aware) for inactive tabs and white for active tab in light mode; white for all tabs in dark mode; no text color change on hover.
- SlidingTabBar background and border now update immediately when switching between light and dark themes.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Returning from Perplexity Configuration to Providers now re-syncs the focused engine with the selected Providers tab.
- Manual install of a pinned engine version no longer immediately auto-installs again because of update detection.
- Explicit "Update now" now installs the latest release instead of reusing the pinned combo-box version.
- Available models fetched from the Perplexity engine no longer show OpenAI branding when Perplexity is the active source.
- Engine action hover artifacts/border seams in the Providers endpoint controls.
- Token generator modal now shows "Step 1 of 3" immediately on first open without requiring a back/forward navigation.
- Token generation errors (including TOTP-related failures) are shown inside the modal instead of the Configuration status area.
- Submitting the TOTP code no longer requires two attempts; stale TOTP prompts no longer re-trigger the input step.
- Token generator correctly handles Rich/ANSI terminal output from the upstream CLI binary.
- Session token is automatically placed in the Session Token field after a successful token generation flow.
- SlidingTabBar no longer stays dark when switching to light mode.
- Active tab text in SlidingTabBar stays white on hover instead of reverting to the inactive color.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- First-class Perplexity engine support alongside CLIProxyAPI, including engine switching from Providers and Configuration.
- Perplexity account management UI with add, remove, default-account selection, and reset confirmation.
- Full-window overlays for account dialogs and confirmation flows so dimming covers the whole app.
- Sliding top tab bars with animated focus indicator for Providers and Configuration.
- GitHub release metadata caching with manual invalidation on refresh/update checks to avoid rate limiting.
- Automatic install-on-startup support for the Perplexity engine when it is missing.
- Sidebar dual-engine status overview for CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity.

### Changed

- Providers page now supports both CLIProxyAPI and Perplexity with focused engine state, per-engine endpoint/start-stop controls, and engine-specific model loading.
- Configuration page reorganized into top tabs: General, CLIProxyAPI, and Perplexity.
- Perplexity security/configuration actions now point to the app settings folder, not the CLIProxy auth folder.
- Perplexity accounts are now stored as separate JSON files under the Tunnel Agent settings directory instead of `settings.json` or `.cli-proxy-api`.
- App startup now defaults Providers focus to CLIProxyAPI while keeping engine selection logic consistent across pages.
- Sidebar branding updated: smaller Tunnel Agent lockup in sidebar, version removed from titlebar.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Available models now query the active engine endpoint/port instead of always using CLIProxyAPI.
- Restored provider-group expansion UI for available models after the multi-engine refactor.
- Perplexity startup health polling no longer crashes the app on `HttpClient` timeout retries.
- Perplexity process startup now surfaces early stderr/crash details instead of only showing a generic timeout.
- Provider account quota bars are rendered again in the expanded account cards.
- Window-root dialogs now dim the full app instead of only the content pane.
- Sidebar status rendering/alignment issues after layout refactor.
- Migration added from legacy `settings.json` Perplexity accounts into file-based account storage.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Check for update button in Configuration → Engine row, visible when no update is pending. Disables while checking.
- Theme selector in Configuration → General: System, Light, or Dark. Persisted across restarts. Sidebar toggle still cycles between Light and Dark in session.
- Confirmation dialog before resetting credentials, rendered as a window-level overlay so it floats correctly over the full app.
- Default settings are written to `settings.json` when the file is empty or missing fields, so new installs and manual edits always produce a complete settings file.
- 230+ passing unit tests.

### Changed

- Repository restructured into `src/TunnelAgent.Avalonia`, `src/TunnelAgent.Core`, `src/TunnelAgent.Infrastructure`, `src/TunnelAgent.Abstractions`, and `tests/TunnelAgent.Tests`. `TunnelAgent.slnx` at root.
- `IsDark` removed from `AppSettings`; theme preference is now `ThemeMode = system|light|dark`.
- `LogLevel` removed from `AppSettings`; CLIProxyAPI always starts with `debug: false`.
- Credential reset now backs up managed token files to `.tunnelagent-backup/{timestamp}/` before deleting them, and only deletes TunnelAgent-managed files (OAuth prefixes and `openai-compat-*.json`). Unrelated JSON in the auth folder is preserved.
- Status messages from credential operations (reset, open folder) appear in the Configuration view, not the Providers view.
- Reset credentials confirmation and status feedback are shown in the correct UI context.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Loading an empty `settings.json` now correctly writes and applies default values.
- OAuth `ConnectAsync` test for a known provider no longer launches the real CLIProxyAPI binary during unit test runs.
- `LaunchAtLoginService` no longer references the `Program` type from the Avalonia project when running from Infrastructure.

### Security

- Pinned `Tmds.DBus.Protocol` to `0.21.3` to resolve CVE-2026-39959 (high severity).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Routing strategy option in Configuration: Round Robin (even distribution) or Fill First (use first account until limit). Applies to both API keys and OAuth accounts.
- "Report an issue" link in sidebar footer opens the GitHub issues page.
- Test suite with 75 passing tests covering converters, engine config, OAuth token detection, provider catalog, auth file watcher, settings, credentials, view models, and service smoke tests.

### Changed

- Auto-update toggle is now disabled when auto-check for updates is off, preventing an inconsistent configuration.
- ComboBox controls show a hand cursor on hover to indicate they are selectable.
- Agents section is disabled in the UI until fully implemented.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Launch at login now works across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- System tray controls let users show or hide the window, manage CLIProxyAPI, open configuration, open the auth folder, and quit the app.

### Changed

- The desktop app now targets cross-platform .NET instead of a Windows-only target framework.
- Closing the main window hides the app to the tray; quitting from the tray exits the app and stops the server.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Configuration now includes richer CLIProxyAPI release selection and install controls.

### Changed

- Provider state and server startup behavior are more reliable during initialization.
- Removed the unused Activity section from the desktop navigation.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Provider management now supports connected accounts, enable/disable state, OAuth and custom providers, live quota bars, and available models from the running proxy.
- Provider rows were redesigned with clearer connection status, account panels, refresh actions, and provider icons.
- OAuth callback pages now show branded success and error states.

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Provider account detection, quota display, refresh animations, add-account tooltips, and account enable/disable persistence now behave correctly.
- CLIProxyAPI owns the OAuth callback port directly, avoiding unsupported callback interception in the desktop app.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

#### Provider Catalog

- `ProviderCatalogService` — orchestrates the full provider lifecycle: auth-dir sync, add/remove accounts, enable/disable, config.yaml rewrite
- `OAuthTokenDetector` — reads `~/.cli-proxy-api/{prefix}-{email}*.json` files to detect connected OAuth providers and parse account metadata (email, plan badge)
- `AuthFileWatcher` — `FileSystemWatcher` with 400 ms debounce over `~/.cli-proxy-api/` to react to new/removed token files in real time
- `CustomProviderCredentialStore` — reads/writes `openai-compat-{id}-{uuid}.json` credential files, compatible with CLIProxyAPI format
- `OAuthService` — launches `cli-proxy-api -<provider>-login` to trigger OAuth browser flow; handles Gemini stdin newline, Codex keepalive, Copilot device-code extraction
- `QuotaFetchService` — fetches live quota from provider APIs using the `access_token` in local token files:
  - **Claude**: `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` → `five_hour` + `seven_day` utilization %
  - **Codex**: `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` → `primary_window` + `secondary_window` used %
  - **Copilot**: `api.github.com/copilot_internal/user` → `premium_interactions` + `chat` quota
- `ModelFetchService` — calls `/v1/models` on the running proxy and groups results by `owned_by`

#### Providers UI (VibeProxy-inspired redesign)

- Provider rows: `[Toggle] [Icon] [Name + colored status line] [action buttons] [›]`
  - Status sub-line: green when connected, orange when disabled, muted otherwise
  - `ConnectedSubText`: "N connected accounts · Round-robin w/ auto-failover"
  - `[disabled]` chip badge when provider is toggled off
- **Toggle pill** with animated sliding white thumb (RotateTransform, CSS-like transition)
- Toggle auto-disabled when no accounts exist; auto-off when last account is removed
- **Expand chevron** (`›` / `˅`) — only visible when provider has accounts; expands account panel
- **`+` icon button** — single entry point for OAuth connect/add-account (always visible for OAuth providers)
- **`LogOut` icon button** — disconnect all accounts (visible only when connected); consistent with per-account disconnect
- Connecting chip badge shown while OAuth flow is in flight
- Custom providers: "Add Account" button opens inline dialog

#### Expanded Account Panel

- Per-account card with email/label, plan badge (PLUS/PRO/FREE), masked API key chip
- **Quota bars**: `ProgressBar` (green fill, 0–1 range) with title, "N% used" label, "Resets in Xd Yh" countdown
- `HasQuota` properly reactive via `CollectionChanged` on `QuotaBars` collection
- **Refresh `↺` button** per account — re-fetches quota from provider API with spinning animation (`RotateTransform.Angle` 0→360, 0.7 s linear)
- Enable/disable toggle per account — **persisted to disk** on change:
  - OAuth accounts: patches `"disabled"` field in `{prefix}-{email}*.json`
  - Custom accounts: patches `openai-compat-*.json` via `CustomProviderCredentialStore`
- `LogOut` icon to remove/disconnect individual account

#### Available Models

- Section shows "Start the server to see available models" (`ServerOff` icon) when proxy is stopped
- When server starts: auto-fetches `/v1/models`, groups by provider (`owned_by`), shows model count per group
- Expandable model groups with model ID (monospace), context hint, provider chip, auth-kind chip
- Total model count updates reactively via `CollectionChanged` on `AvailableModelGroups`

### Changed

- `AppSettings` extended with `ProviderSettings` and `ProviderAccountSettings` classes
- `EngineConfigService` rewrote config generation to produce real `oauth-excluded-models` and `openai-compatibility` YAML blocks from live provider state
- `MainWindowViewModel` wires `ProviderCatalogService`; providers loaded from catalog (not seeded)
- `App.axaml.cs` instantiates and passes `EngineConfigService` + `ProviderCatalogService` to the ViewModel
- `ProvidersView` header renamed "Services" to match VibeProxy

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Provider row `Button` wrapper disabled all children (toggle, connect) — replaced with `Grid` + name-only clickable `Button.provider-row-name`
- Grey background on unconnected provider rows — forced `Transparent` on `ContentPresenter` in base state
- `window.close()` removed from OAuth callback page (doesn't work in non-script-opened tabs)
- OAuth callback page `Setter.Value` crash (`Cannot use a control as a Setter value`) — replaced Content setter with `ControlTemplate`
- `RenderTransform` animation crash — replaced string value with `RotateTransform` + `(RotateTransform.Angle)` property path
- Duplicate "connecting…" chip (appeared in both name area and action buttons)
- `TotalAvailableModelCount` always returning 0 — wired `CollectionChanged` on `AvailableModelGroups`
- `RemoveAccountAsync` for OAuth accounts (was passing empty `ApiKey`) — now uses `Email` to find token file
- Account enable/disable toggle not persisted across restarts — wired `IsDisabledChanged` event to disk write
- Add account tooltip showing `True`/`False` — replaced converter binding with static string
- Quota bar spacing (no gap between bars) — increased `Margin` to `0,6,0,0`
- Refresh button `IsRefreshing` not always restored — dispatched to UI thread in `finally` block

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Initial Avalonia UI with custom titlebar, collapsible sidebar, and dark/light theme toggle
- Providers view with connected service cards and sparkline usage graphs
- Agents view with install status and route provider assignment
- Activity view with request log (method, path, agent, provider, model, status, latency)
- Configuration view with General, Network, Security, and Engine sections
- `EngineDownloadService` — downloads and installs the CLIProxyAPI binary from GitHub Releases
  - Platform-aware asset selection (Windows zip, macOS/Linux tar.gz)
  - Progress reporting during download
  - Automatic first-launch download when binary is missing
- `EngineConfigService` — generates `proxy-config.yaml` in the platform settings directory
  - Windows: `%AppData%\TunnelAgent\proxy-config.yaml`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/TunnelAgent/proxy-config.yaml`
  - Linux: `~/.config/TunnelAgent/proxy-config.yaml`
- `EngineProcessService` — starts and monitors the CLIProxyAPI process
  - Launches with `-config <path>` flag
  - Health polling to confirm server is up before marking Running
  - Crash detection via process Exited event
- `EngineService` — thin orchestrator composing the three services above
- `IPlatformInfo` interface with `WindowsPlatform`, `MacOsPlatform`, `LinuxPlatform` implementations
  - Per-platform binary name, archive format, OS/arch suffix, settings/data/auth directories
- `AppSettings` and `SettingsService` — persistent settings in platform roaming directory
- Update check via GitHub redirect URL (no API rate limit)
- Auto-check for updates on startup (configurable)
- Auto-update toggle (downloads and installs silently)
- Update notification: sidebar badge, startup toast (auto-dismisses after 8s), inline ENGINE card
- Manual "Update now" button with progress bar and success banner
- Port change in UI immediately rewrites config and restarts the engine if running
- Management control panel download disabled (`disable-control-panel: true`)

### Added

- **Pi context window**: when configuring Pi, `contextWindow` is now fetched from OpenRouter's public `/v1/models` endpoint and written per-model in `models.json`. Results are cached in-memory. If a model is not found, the field is omitted (Pi defaults to 128k).

### Fixed

- Binary stored in `%LocalAppData%` (not roaming) — executables should not roam
- Settings stored in roaming `%AppData%` / `~/Library/Preferences` / `~/.config`
- CLIProxyAPI binary keeps its original name (`cli-proxy-api` / `cli-proxy-api.exe`)
- Version parsing handles `CLIProxyAPI Version: 7.0.2, Commit: ...` output format
- Version comparison normalises `v` prefix to avoid false update notifications
- Update check uses GitHub HTML redirect instead of API endpoint to avoid 60 req/h rate limit
- Engine always reads version from binary at startup (never trusts cached value)
- Update notification triggers reactively from `StateChanged` rather than at a fixed startup point
